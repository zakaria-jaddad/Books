## 1.1 Getting Started

The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it, so the first program we will write is the popular **Hello, World!** program

In the **C language** printing **"Hello, World!”** is like this

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/*
- Book Explanation
	include information about standard library
  define a function called main
  that received no argument values
  statements of main are enclosed in braces
  main calls library function printf
  to print this sequence of characters
  \n represents the newline character
*/
int main() {
	printf("Hello, Wrold!\n");
}
```

The file that has the code should end with the ".c” extension, to run it depends on the system used for example there are `cc hello.c`, `gcc hello.c` or `clang hello.c` all this commands produce an executable file like this "a.out” or "hello”.

when it gets executed the "**Hello, World!**” will be printed in the terminal.

So A **C** program whatever it's size its size, consists only of functions, variables and the functions contain statements, so C is a functional language.

in the above example we have a function with the name `main` so the name main in **C** is a special, it is were the program start executing that means that every program must have a main function somewhere.

main usually call other functions to preform it's job, as you can see in the example above we have a `printf` function inside `main`, this function is not implemented in our example, so where is it?

In the top of our code there is the `#include <stdio.h>` a header that tells the compiler to include information about the `Standard input/output library` where the `printf` function is defined and implemented.

Functions communicate and share data with each other using _arguments_ inside `()`_,_ in our `main` implementation we didn't provide any arguments to it.

A function can be called by using it's name and parentheses `printf()` , this function takes a lot of arguments but in out example it takes just the string **"Hello, World!”.**

The `\n` is a C notation of new line, it's _escape sequence character,_ we will know more about those later, so `\n` informs `printf` to print a new line to understand it more we can implement the same Hello, World! program like this ways

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main() {
	printf("hello, ");  // no new line
	printf("world!");    // no new line
	printf("\n");       // new line here
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main() {
	printf("hello, World!");  // no new line
	printf("\n");       // new line here
}
```

Basically you can imaging a program that print each character it self then at the end prints new line, all would have the same output.

### Exercise 1-2.

Experiment to find out what happens when prints's argument string contains `\c`, where c is some character not listed above.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	printf("Hello, world! \c\n");  // Warning here
}

```

This program give a compilation Warning for an unknown escape character `\c`

## 1.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

In the next program we will use the formula `oC=(5/9)(oF-32)` to print Fahrenheit
temperatures and their Celsius equivalents like this

```c
1   -17
20   -6
40    4
60   15
80   26
100  37
120  48
140  60
160  71
180  82
200  93
220 104
240 115
260 126
280 137
300 148
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */
main() {
	int fahr, celsius;
	int lower, upper, step;

	lower = 0; /* lower limit of temperature scale */
	upper = 300; /* upper limit */
	step = 20; /* step size */
	fahr = lower;

	while (fahr <= upper) {
		celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9;
		printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
		fahr = fahr + step;
	}
}
```

so let's break the code piece by piece.

- we know the `#include <stdio.h>` to import functions from the standard input/output
- we have the `/**/` this sign is a comment when using it the compiler ignores whatever is written inside it, in this example it describes the purpose of the function
- `int fahr, celsius;` and `int lower, upper, step;` these are declaration statement in C all variables must be declared before they are used, usually at the beginning of the function
  - here the `int` means that variables value must be of type Integer, this is important and here is why, when compiling the code by the compiler we need to specify what is the type of the variable to know how much memory the compiler should assign to it or allocate to it i don't know wish term should i use here
  - C provides several data types beside `int` here are some of them
    - `char`: character a single byte
    - `short`: short integer
    - `long`: long integer
    - `double`: double-precision floating point
- `lower = 0; upper = 300; step = 20; fahr = lower;` those are assignment statements each variable will store a value `fahr` would get the value of `lower` which in this cast the value `0`
- for the `while loop code` the while loop has a condition statement and a body so
  - the condition is `(fahr <= upper)` every iteration the program check if `fahr` value is lower of equals to `upper` value if true the body will be executed if false the program continues executing other code
  - `printf` takes a weird string as a first argument let's break it down
    - `%d` is specified for printing integers in this case instead of getting %d we will get the value of fahr
    - `\t` is an escaping character stands for printing a tab which is 4 spaces.
  - notice in each iteration the fahr's value increments by the step value

```c
	while (fahr <= upper) {
		celsius = 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9;
		printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
		fahr = fahr + step;
	}
```

The output of the printf is not well organized we can solve that by doing this

this prints the first number of each line in a field three digits wide, and the second in a field six
digits wide, like this.

```c
printf("%3d %6d\n", fahr, celsius);
/*
Output
  0   -17
 20    -6
 40     4
 60    15
 80    26
100    37
...
*/
```

If you know 0 F is actually about -17.8 C, to get more specific output we need to change the type of the variables in the example from `int` to `float` so that it can accept floating point numbers let's update it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/*
  Formula: oC=(5/9)(oF-32)
 */
int main(void)
{
  // declaration
  float fahr, celsius;
  float lower, upper, step;

  // assignment
  lower = 0;
  upper = 300;
  step = 20;

  fahr = lower;
  while (fahr <= upper)
  {
    celsius = (5.0 / 9.0) * (fahr - 32.0);
    printf("%3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
    fahr = fahr + step;
  }
}
```

This still the same logic, changing types allows the formula for conversion to be written in a more natural way, remember in the previous example we hade the `int` data type we couldn't do the `5 / 9` operation because this would produce a floating point number and would lead to an compilation error.

The `printf` conversion specification `%3.0f` specifies that `fahr` should be `foat` and to be printed at least three characters wide, with no decimal point and no fraction digit, instead for `celsius` which want to be printed at least 6 characters wide and 1 digit after the decimal point so the output would look like this:

```c
  0  -17.8
 20   -6.7
 40    4.4
 60   15.6
 80   26.7
100   37.8
120   48.9
140   60.0

```

```c
160   71.1
180   82.2
200   93.3
220  104.4
240  115.6
260  126.7
280  137.8
300  148.9

```

here are some examples of with and precision:

| %d    | print as decimal integer                                                                |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| %6d   | print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide                                    |
| %f    | print as a floating point number                                                        |
| %6f   | print as a floating point number, at least 6 characters width                           |
| %.2f  | print as a floating point number with 2 characters after decimal                        |
| %6.2f | print as a floating point number with 2 characters after decimal, at least 6 chars with |
| %o    | print as octal                                                                          |
| %x    | print as hex                                                                            |
| %c    | print as char                                                                           |
| %c    | print as string                                                                         |
| %%    | print the symbol %                                                                      |

There are more than these precisions.

### Exercise 1-3

Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/*
  Formula: oC=(5/9)(oF-32)
 */
int main(void)
{
  // declaration
  float fahr, celsius;
  float lower, upper, step;

  // assignment
  lower = 0;
  upper = 300;
  step = 20;

  fahr = lower;
  // print Heading above Table
  printf("Termpurature conversion program");


  while (fahr <= upper)
  {
    celsius = (5.0 / 9.0) * (fahr - 32.0);
    printf("%3.0f | %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
    fahr = fahr + step;
  }
}
```

### Exercise 1-4

Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/*
  Formula: F = C * (9 / 5) + 32
 */
int main(void) {

  // decaration
  float celsius, fahr;
  float lower, upper, step;

  // assignment
  lower = 0;
  upper = 300;
  step = 20;

  printf("Termpurature conversion program from Celsius to Fah.\n");

  while (celsius <= upper)
  {
    fahr = (celsius + 32) * (9.0 / 5.0);
    printf("fahr: %3.0f | celsius: %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
    celsius = celsius + step;
  }
}
```

## 1.3 The for statement

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */
main()
{
	int fahr;
	for (fahr = 0; fahr <= 300; fahr = fahr + 20)
	printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
}
```

This example has the same output as the previous one.

but here we have used a for loop and we the conversion operation is inserted as an argument to `printf` .

The `for` statement is the same as the `while` loop but more cleaner where we don't need to think about the variables and updating them all operations happens inside the `()` , it contains three parts

1. `fahr = 0` : this is the assignment of the initial value of the `fahr` inside the loop.
2. `fahr <= 300` : a condition that is evaluated if true the body of the loop get executed if false the body of it won't get executed
3. `fahr = fahr + 20` : here we want in each iteration the value of the `fahr` get incremented by 20

### Exercise 1-5

Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order,
that is, from 300 degrees to 0.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/*
  Formula: F = C * (9 / 5) + 32
 */
int main(void)
{

  // decaration
  float celsius, fahr;
  float lower, upper, step;

  // assignment
  lower = 0;
  upper = 300;
  step = 20;

  printf("Termpurature conversion program from Celsius to Fah.\n");

  while (celsius <= upper)
  {
    fahr = (celsius + 32) * (9.0 / 5.0);
    printf("fahr: %3.0f | celsius: %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
    celsius = celsius + step;
  }
  printf("==========\n");


  for (int celsius = 300; celsius >= 0; celsius = celsius - 20)
  {
    printf("fahr: %3.0f | celsius: %6d\n", (celsius + 32) * (9.0 / 5.0), celsius);
  }
}
```

## 1.4 Symbolic Constants

So in the temperature program, it's bad practice to bury numbers inside the program like 300 and 20, one way to deal with this is to create `constants` using the `#define` key word, later if we want to change the value of the variable it’easy to change in just one place.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define LOWER 0 /* lower limit of table */
#define UPPER 300 /* upper limit */
#define STEP 20 /* step size */
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */
main()
{
	int fahr;
	for (fahr = LOWER; fahr <= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP)
	printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
}
```

so the `LOWER` `UPPER` are symbolic constants it's best practice to write them in uppercase.

notice that the end of definition there is no `;`

## 1.5 Character Input and Output

Input is just some data that the user prompt to the program.

output is the data that the program returns. these are my definition i could be wrong though 🙂

so the get an input or output in C you could use the `stdio` library using `getchar and putchar`

`getchar` get a character form the user.

`putchar` print a character to the user

using this you can write a lot of fun programs like a file copying program

where user write a charter and the program print it

```c
// pseudocode
/*
read a character
	while (character is not end-of-file indicator)
		output the character just read
		read a character
		Converting this into C gives:
*/

#include <stdio.h>
/* copy input to output; 1st version */
main()
{
	int c;
	c = getchar();
	while (c != EOF) {
		putchar(c);
		c = getchar();
	}
}

// or this
int main() {
	int c;

	while ((c == getchar()) != EOF) {
		putchar(c);
	}
}
```

so here we prompt the user for a char then we check if it is equal to `EOF` but what is EOF?

`EOF` represent _End Of File_ it is a constant in the `stdio.h` library and it has the value of `-1` .

char are represented as a numbers from 0 to 255 as 1 byte that's why we specified an `int` type for `c` , notice that `EOF`is not included this is why check to it .

if false user prompted with new value if false it's end of file .

### Exercise 1-6

Verify that the expression `getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1`

0: means true.

1: means false.

### Exercise 1-7

Write a program to print the value of EOF.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("This is the value of EOF: %d\n", EOF); // value of EOF is -1
  return 0;
}
```

### 1.5.2 Character Counting

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/* count characters in input; 1st version */
main()
{
	long nc;
	nc = 0;

	while (getchar() != EOF)
		++nc;
	printf("%ld\n", nc); // ld conversion means long
}
```

Here we count how many chars in the input .

The `++nc` is to increment the `nc` by one, the `++nc` and `nc++` both increment value by one but in a different way

To explain here is this code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
/* count characters in input; 1st version */
main()
{
	int c = 0;
	printf("%d", ++c) // --> This would increment value by one and print it 1
	printf("%d", c++) // --> This would print value and incremented so 1
	printf("%d", c)   // --> This is 2
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  double nc;

  // i reallu don't know how this works and see not output.
  for (nc = 0; getchar() != EOF; ++nc)
    ;
  printf("%0.f\n", nc);
}
```

This prints how many characters in the input.

### 1.5.3 Line Counting

This program counts input lines each time user make a new line we increment counter value.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int character;
  int line_counter = 0;
  while ((character = getchar()) != EOF)
  {
    if (character == '\n')
    {
      ++line_counter;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", line_counter);
}
```

Inside the `while` loop we have an `if` statement either `true` or `false` .

if you notice we compare number to char but a char is represented in C as an ASCCI value so the value of `'A' = 65` so, the escape sequence like `'\n'` note this is just a character and it is represented as 10 in ASCCI

### Exercise 1-8

Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int counter = 0;
  int c;

  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
  {
    if (c == '\n' || c == '\t' || c == ' ') {
      ++counter;
    }
  }
  printf("%d\n", counter);
}
```

### Exercise 1-9

Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or
more blanks by a single blank.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int character;
  int is_balnk = 0;

  while ((character = getchar()) != EOF)
  {

    if (character == ' ')
    {
      if (is_balnk == 0)
      {
        putchar(' ');
      }
      is_balnk = 1;
    }
    else
    {
      putchar(character);
      is_balnk = 0;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

### Exercise 1-10

Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each
backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an
unambiguous way.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int character;
  int tab_counter = 0;
  int is_blank = 0;

  while ((character = getchar()) != EOF)
  {
    if (character == '\b')
    {
      putchar('\\');
      putchar('b');
    }
    if (character == '\\')
    {
      putchar('\\');
    }
    if (character == ' ')
    {
      is_blank = 1;
      ++tab_counter;
      if (tab_counter == 4)
      {
        putchar('\\');
        putchar('t');
        tab_counter = 0;
      }
    }
    else
    {
      for (int i = 0; i < tab_counter; i++)
      {
        putchar(' ');
      }
      tab_counter = 0;
      is_blank = 0;
    }
    if (is_blank == 0)
    {
      putchar(character);
    }
    is_blank = 0;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This is not a good solution but it's 3:30 AM so freak it, it is what it is.

### 1.5.4 Word Counting

This Program count words, lines, and characters

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define IN 1 /* inside a word */
#define OUT 0 /* outside a word */
/* count lines, words, and characters in input */
main()
{
	int c, nl, nw, nc, state;
	state = OUT;
	nl = nw = nc = 0;
	while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
		++nc;
		if (c == '\n')
			++nl;
		if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c = '\t')
			state = OUT;
		else if (state == OUT) {
			state = IN;
			++nw;
		}
	}
	printf("%d %d %d\n", nl, nw, nc);
}
```

`||` : This is the OR operator.

`&&` : This is the AND operator.

when if statement is satisfied else if wont be checked.

### Exercise 1-11

How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

1. There is a type on the second if statement when checking if c equals to ‘\t’

This is the only problem in the code

### Exercise 1-12

Write a program that prints its input one word per line.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define IN 1
#define OUT 0

int main(void)
{

	int c, state;
	state = OUT;
	while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
	{
    if ((c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')) {
			if (state == IN) {
				putchar('\n');
				state = OUT;
			}
		}
		else {
			putchar(c);
			state = IN;
		}
	}
}

```

## 1.6 Arrays

In this program we count the occurrence of each number and spaces "Blank, Tab, New Line”

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int c, i, nwhite, nother;
    int ndigit[10];

    // set 0 to each digit
    nwhite = nother = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    {
        ndigit[i] = 0;
    }

    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
    {
        // checks if c is a number
        if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')
        {
            // c - '0' to get c value
            ++ndigit[c - '0'];
        }
        else if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
        {
            ++nwhite;
        }
        else
        {
            ++nother;
        }
    }

    // print output
    printf("digits: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    { // i++ and ++i here is the same thing
        printf(" %d", ndigit[i]);
    }
    printf(", white space = %d, other = %d\n",
           nwhite, nother);
}
```

`int ndigit[10];` This is an array declaration of type integer, in C we declare an array and give it's length.

using `for` we can traverse the array, using `[i]` to get an index of it in an each iteration.

### Exercise 1-13

Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is
easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_LENGTH 10
#define IN 1
#define OUT 0

int main(void)
{
  int c, state, char_counter;
  int nword[MAX_LENGTH] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
  state = OUT;
  char_counter = 0;

  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
  {
    if ((c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t'))
    {
      if (state == IN)
      {
        if (char_counter < MAX_LENGTH)
        {
          ++nword[char_counter - 1];
        }
        state = OUT;
        char_counter = 0;
      }
    }
    else
    {
      ++char_counter;
      state = IN;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_LENGTH; i++)
  {
    printf("%2d | ", i + 1);
    for (int j = 0; j < nword[i]; j++)
    {
      putchar('*');
    }
    putchar('\n');
  }
}

```

```c
	input: hello hello
	output:
	 1 |
	 2 |
	 3 |
	 4 |
	 5 | **
	 6 |
	 7 |
	 8 |
	 9 |
	10 |
```

I asked AI if this solution is correct and it says yes so yes it is 🙂.

### Exercise 1-14

Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters
in its input.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define OUT 0
#define IN 1
#define CHARS_NUMBER 127
#define IGNORED_CHARS 32

int main(void)
{
  int c, state;
  int nchars[CHARS_NUMBER];

  for (int i = 0; i < CHARS_NUMBER; i++)
  {
    nchars[i] = 0;
  }

  state = OUT;

  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
  {
    ++nchars[c - IGNORED_CHARS];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < CHARS_NUMBER; i++)
  {
    if (nchars[i] > 0)
    {
      printf("%3c | ", i + IGNORED_CHARS);
      for (int j = 0; j < nchars[i]; j++)
      {
        putchar('#');
      }
      putchar('\n');
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

```c
input: Hello, world! This is a test input for the histogram program.
	output:
	   | ##########
	!  | #
	,  | #
	.  | #
	H  | #
	T  | #
	a  | ###
	d  | #
	e  | ###
	f  | #
	g  | ##
	h  | ###
	i  | ####
	l  | ###
	m  | ##
	n  | #
	o  | #####
	p  | ##
	r  | #####
	s  | ####
	t  | #####
	u  | #
	w  | #
```

## 1.7 Functions

So far we have used several function `printf` `getchar` `puthcar` but, these functions ared defined in the _Standard input output library._

let's make functions, since C has no exponentiation operator, let's make a function to power an integer `power(m, n)`;

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int power(int m, int n); // function declaration

int main(void)
{

  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
  {
    printf("%d %d %d\n", i, power(2, i), power(-3, i));
  }
  return 0;
}

// int power(base, n)
// int base, n;
int power(int base, int n)
{
  int p;
  p = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
  {
    p = p * base;
  }
  return p;
}
```

```c
return-type function-name(parameter declarations, if any)
{
	declarations
	statements
}
```

`int power(int base, int n)` : is a definition function

### Exercise 1.15

Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function
for conversion.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */

#define STEP 20
#define UPPER 300

double fah_to_cels(int fahr);

int main(void)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < UPPER; i = i + STEP) {
    printf("%3d | %3.1f\n", i, fah_to_cels(i));
  }
}

double fah_to_cels(int fahr)
{
  return (5.0 / 9.0) * (fahr - 32.0);
}
```

The `fah_to_cels` : is a function produce `double` type and take an `int` type.

## 1.8 Arguments - Call by Value

This is the part that got me a lot of headache we first covering this topic, it’s the different between passing by value and passing by reference.

in C we pass by value to a function for primitive data types such `int double char...` but, for non primitive like Arrays we pass by reference "_Arrays memory address_” to a function, there is no array's copying.

also in C we can pass primitive data types by reference using a pointer more on that later.

## 1.9 Character Arrays

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXLENGTH 1000

int foo(char line[], int lim);
void copy(char to[], char from[]);

int main(void)
{

  int length;
  int max;
  char line[MAXLENGTH];
  char longest[MAXLENGTH];

  max = 0;
  while ((length = foo(line, MAXLENGTH)) > 0)
  {
    if (length > max)
    {
      max = length;
      copy(longest, line);
    }
    if (max > 0)
    {
      printf("%s", longest);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}

int foo(char s[], int lim)
{
  int i, c;

  for (i = 0; i < lim - 1 && (c = getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n'; ++i)
    s[i] = c;
  if (c == '\n')
  {
    s[i] = c;
    ++i;
  }
  s[i] = '\0';
  return i;
}

void copy(char to[], char from[])
{
  int i = 0;
  while ((to[i] = from[i]) != '\0')
    i++;
}
```

### Exercise 1-16

Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print
the length of arbitrary long input lines, and as much as possible of the text

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXLENGTH 1000

int foo(char line[], int lim);
void copy(char to[], char from[]);

int main(void)
{

  int length;
  int max;
  char line[MAXLENGTH];
  char longest[MAXLENGTH];

  max = 0;
  while ((length = foo(line, MAXLENGTH)) > 0)
  {
    if (length > max)
    {
      max = length;
      copy(longest, line);
    }
    if (max > 0)
    {
      printf("%s...\n", longest);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}

int foo(char s[], int lim)
{
  int i, j, c;

  for (i = 0, j = 0; (c = getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n'; ++i) {
    if (i < lim - 1) {
      s[j] = c;
      j++;
    }
  }
  if (c == '\n')
  {
    s[j] = c;
    ++j;
  }
  s[j] = '\0';
  return i;
}

void copy(char to[], char from[])
{
  int i = 0;
  while ((to[i] = from[i]) != '\0')
    i++;
}
```

here i couldn't store all characters due to i still didn't learn about memory in C, so i only stored a string of `MAXLENGTH` and count all string chars.

### Exercise 1-17

Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters

```c
/*
  Exercise 1-17. Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters
  when user write an input  after they press new line '\n'
  get it and check if that line has more than 80 lines
  store it in the mu_string array
  and using for loop print it
 */
#include <stdio.h>

int get_user_line(char s[], int limit);

#define MINLENGTH 3
#define MAXLENGTH 10000

int main(void)
{
  char my_string[MAXLENGTH];
  int c;
  while (MINLENGTH < get_user_line(my_string, MAXLENGTH))
  {
    int i;
    i = 0;
    while (my_string[i] != '\0')
    {
      printf("%c", my_string[i]);
      ++i;
    }
  }
}

int get_user_line(char s[], int limit)
{
  int c, i, j;
  j = i = 0;
  while ((c = getchar()) != '\n')
  {
    if (i < limit - 2)
    {
      s[j] = c;
      ++j;
    }
    ++i;
  }
  s[j] = '\n';
  s[j + 1] = '\0';
  return i;
}
```

### Exercise 1-18

Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input,
and to delete entirely blank lines

```c
/*
  Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines
 */
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXLENGTH 300

int get_user_line(char s[], int limit);
void format_line(char line[], char new_line[]);
void print_line(char line[]);

int main(void)
{
  char line[MAXLENGTH];
  while (get_user_line(line, MAXLENGTH) == 0)
  {
    char formatted_line[MAXLENGTH];
    format_line(line, formatted_line);
    print_line(formatted_line);
  }
  return 0;
}

int get_user_line(char s[], int limit)
{
  int c, i;
  for (i = 0; i < limit - 2 && (c = getchar()) != '\n'; ++i)
  {
    s[i] = c;
  }
  s[i] = '\n';
  s[i + 1] = '\0';
  return 0;
}

void format_line(char line[], char new_line[])
{
  int i, j;
  i = j = 0;
  while (line[i] != '\0')
  {
    if (line[i] != ' ' && line[i] != '\t')
    {
      new_line[j] = line[i];
      ++j;
    }
    ++i;
  }
}

void print_line(char line[])
{
  int i;
  i = 0;
  while (line[i] != '\0')
  {
    printf("%c", line[i]);
    ++i;
  }
}
```

for the sake of not using pointers this took me over 1 day, there is only one bug here if second input is fewer then previous one it will look like this

```
first input: "HelloWorld"
second input: "1337"
The output of the second input would be like this
-> "1337\n\0orld" :)
```

### Exercise 1-19

Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s. Use it to
write a program that reverses its input a line at a time.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int get_user_line(char s[], int limit);
void reverse_line(char s[], char reversed_line[], int limit);
void print_line(char line[]);
void new_string(char s[], int limit);

#define MAXLENGTH 300

int main(void)
{
  char s[MAXLENGTH];

  while (get_user_line(s, MAXLENGTH) == 0)
  {
    char reversed_line[MAXLENGTH];
    new_string(reversed_line, MAXLENGTH);

    reverse_line(s, reversed_line, MAXLENGTH);
    print_line(reversed_line);
  }
}

int get_user_line(char s[], int limit)
{
  new_string(s, limit);
  int c, i;
  i = 0;

  while (i < limit - 2 && (c = getchar()) != '\n')
  {
    s[i] = c;
    ++i;
  }
  s[i] = '\n';
  s[i + 1] = '\0';

  return 0;
}

void reverse_line(char s[], char reversed_line[], int limit)
{

  int i, j;
  j = 0;

  for (i = limit - 2; i >= 0; i = i - 1)
  {
    if (s[i] >= '!' && s[i] <= '~')
    {
      reversed_line[j] = s[i];
      ++j;
    }
  }
  reversed_line[j] = '\n';
  reversed_line[j + 1] = '\0';
}

void print_line(char line[])
{
  int i;
  i = 0;
  while (line[i] != '\0')
  {
    printf("%c", line[i]);
    ++i;
  }

}

void new_string(char s[], int limit) {
  for (int i = 0; i < limit; i++)
  {
    s[i] = ' ';
  }
}
```

the `new_string` function just assign spaces to all array indexes.

## 1.10 External Variables and Scope

so as an alternative to _automatic variables_ it's possible to define variable to be external _global variables_

external variable must be defined once in outside of any function.

to use an external variable in the function you need to use the `extern` word for example

```c
int foo;

int main(void) {
	extern int foo;
}
```

`extern` word in this example cause storage to be allocated for the variable `foo` in the `main` function.

when it comes to pest practice we can ignore the `extern` word also this kind of global variables we store them in a header.

a header file like `stdio.h` has declaration of global variables and functions, that we include using the `#include`

**You should note that we are using the words definition and declaration carefully here is why:**

- Declaration introduces the name and type of a variable, function, but it doesn't allocate memory or initialize value of variable.

```c
int foo(int baz, int bar);
```

- Definition not only declares the name and type of a variable or function but also allocates memory for variables and initializes them

```c
int x = 5;

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

```

variables that we declare inside functions are local known as _automatic variables_, it means that we can access them in other functions unless we pass them as a parameters.

i start learning `lldb` debugger it's nice and easy to use, batter than vs shity debugger.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXLENGTH 400

// Global variables
int ntabs = 3;

int get_user_line(char s[], int limit);
void remove_line_tabs(char s[], char formatted_line[]);
void print_line(char formatted_line[]);

int main(void)
{
  char s[MAXLENGTH];
  while (get_user_line(s, MAXLENGTH) == 0)
  {
    char formatted_line[MAXLENGTH];
    remove_line_tabs(s, formatted_line);
    print_line(formatted_line);
  }
}

int get_user_line(char s[], int limit)
{
  int c, i;
  i = 0;

  while (i < limit - 1 && (c = getchar()) != '\n')
  {

### Exercise 1-21

Write a program `entab` that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum
number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for `detab`.
When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given
preference?

if these are wrong i'm not gonna repeat them this was my approach.

count number of tabs, when hitting a space replace it by number of tabs passed \* a tab.

### Exercise 1-22

Write a program to '’fold'' long input lines into two or more shorter lines after
the last non-blank character that occurs before the `n-th` column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "../header/tab.h"

void format_line(char line[], char new_line[]);

int ncolumn = 14;

int main(void)
{
  char s[MAXLENGTH];

  while (get_user_line(s, MAXLENGTH) == 0)
  {
    char formatted_line[MAXLENGTH];
    format_line(s, formatted_line);
    print_line(formatted_line);
  }
}

void format_line(char line[], char new_line[])
{
  int i, last_space, no_space_flag;

  last_space = -1; // -1 means no space before
  i = no_space_flag = 0;

  while (line[i] != '\n')
  {
    if (i % ncolumn == 0 && i != 0)
    {
      if (line[i] == ' ')
      {
        new_line[i] = '\n';
      }
      else
      {
        if (last_space != -1)
        {
          new_line[last_space] = '\n';
        }
        else
        {
          no_space_flag = -1;
        }
        new_line[i] = line[i];
      }
    }
    else
    {

  new_line[i + 1] = '\0';
}
```

There is a bug here can't say it though

### Exercise 1-23

Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to
handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C comments don't nes

```c
// this is by far the hardest
#include <stdio.h>
#include "../header/tab.h"

int get_file_input(char s[], int limit);
void remove_comments(char line[], char new_line[]);
int main(void)
{
  //  get file input of size MAXLENGHT
  char s[MAXLENGTH];
  get_file_input(s, MAXLENGTH);

  // remove comments
  char formatted_input[MAXLENGTH];
  remove_comments(s, formatted_input);

  // print new file input without any comment
  print_line(formatted_input);
  return 0;
}

void remove_comments(char line[], char new_line[])
{
  int i, is_single_comment, is_multiple_comment, new_line_index;
  is_single_comment = is_multiple_comment = -1;

  for (i = new_line_index = 0; line[i] != '\0'; ++i)
  {
    if (is_single_comment == -1 && is_multiple_comment == -1) {
      // if single line comment
      if (line[i] == '/' && line[i + 1] == '/') {
        is_single_comment = i;
      }
      // if multiple line comment detected
      else if (line[i] == '/' && line[i + 1] == '*') {
        is_multiple_comment = i;
      }
      else {
        new_line[new_line_index] = line[i];
        ++new_line_index;
      }
    }
    else {
    // if end of multiple line comment
      if (line[i - 1] == '*' && line[i] == '/')
      {
        is_multiple_comment = -1;
      }
      else if (line[i] == '\n' || line[i] == '\0')  {
        is_single_comment = -1;
      }
    }
  }
}

int get_file_input(char s[], int limit)
{
  int c, i;
  i = 0;
  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
  {
    if (i > limit - 1)
    {
      printf("File Max length is: %d", limit);
      return -1;
    }
    s[i] = c;
    ++i;
  }
  s[i] = '\0';
  return 0;
}

```

**At this point we have covered what might be called the conventional core of C. With this handful of building blocks, it's possible to write useful programs of considerable size, and it would probably be a good idea if you paused long enough to do so. These exercises suggest programs of somewhat greater complexity than the ones earlier in this chapter** 💜.

## 2.1 Variable Names

in C variable are Upper and lower case letters are distinct so `int FOO;` is not the same as `int foo;` .

A variable and a symbolic constants should be named up of letters, number + the first character should be a letter an `_` counts a letter.

The best practice is to

- use lower case letters for variable names.
- use upper case letters for symbolic constants.

## 2.2 Data Types and Sizes

### What are qualifiers in C

C qualifiers serve to modify the size or behavior of data types.

In C There are a few data types:

1. Integer Types:
   - `int`: Represents integers hole numbers with a typical size of 4 bytes.
   - `char`: Represents single character typically 1 byte long, represented as a number from 0 → 255.
2. Floating Point Types:
   - `float`: Represents single-precision floating point number with a typical size of 4 bytes.
   - `double`: Represents double-precision floating point number with a typical size of 8 bytes.

In addition there are a number of qualifiers that can be applied these basic types.

- The qualifiers `short` and `long` apply to integers for example:

  ```c
  int faz;       // -> int with size of at least 2 bytes to 4 bytes

  short int foo; // -> short int with a typical size of 2 bytes or less

  long int bar;  // -> long int with a typical size of at least 4 to 8 bytes
  ```

  the `int` word can be omitted like this:

  ```c
  int faz;   // -> int with size of at least 2 bytes to 4 bytes

  short foo; // -> short int with a typical size of 2 bytes or less

  long bar;  // -> long int with a typical size of at least 4 to 8 bytes
  ```

  This has the same behavior, i used to think that `long` and `short` are data types just because this.
  to summarize : `short <= int <= long` .

- The qualifiers `unsigned` and `signed` apply to chars or any integer, so what is the difference
  - unsigned numbers are always positive or 0 for example
  ```c
  7 is an unsigned integer, 7 is greater or queal to 0.
  -7 and +7 are signed integers, +7 >= 0 >= -7.
  ```
  for example, char is 8 bits, 1 byte, so
  ```c
  unsigned char foo; // have values from 0 to 255
  signed char bar;   // have values from -128 to 127
  ```

Printable characters always have positive value.

- `long` for `double` types
  The size of long double can varies from a system to another but in the most cases it's typical size

### Exercise 2-1

Write a program to determine the ranges of char, short, int, and long
variables, both signed and unsigned, by printing appropriate values from standard headers
and by direct computation. Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the various
floating-point types

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <float.h>

/*

*/

int main(void)
{
  // chars
  printf("max value of signed char:          %30d\n", SCHAR_MAX);
  printf("min value of signed char:          %30d\n", SCHAR_MIN);

  printf("min value of unsigned char:        %30d\n", 0);
  printf("max value of unsigned char:        %30d\n", UCHAR_MAX);

  printf("min value of char:                 %30d\n", CHAR_MIN);
  printf("max value of char:                 %30d\n", CHAR_MAX);

  // shorts
  printf("min value of signed shorts:        %30d\n", SHRT_MIN);
  printf("max value of signed shorts:        %30d\n", SHRT_MAX);

  printf("min value of unsigned shorts:      %30d\n", 0);
  printf("max value of unsigned shorts:      %30d\n", USHRT_MAX);

  printf("min value of shorts:               %30d\n", SHRT_MIN);
  printf("max value of shorts:               %30d\n", SHRT_MAX);

  // ints
  printf("min value of unsigned ints:        %30d\n", 0);
  printf("max value of unsigned ints:        %30d\n", UINT_MAX);

  printf("min value of signed ints:          %30d\n", INT_MIN);
  printf("max value of signed ints:          %30d\n", INT_MAX);

  // longs
  printf("min value of unsigned longs:       %30d\n", 0);
  printf("max value of unsigned longs:       %30ld\n", ULONG_MAX);

  printf("min value of signed longs:         %30ld\n", LONG_MIN);
  printf("max value of signed longs:         %30ld\n", LONG_MAX);

  // long longs
  printf("min value of unsigned long longs:  %30d\n", 0);
  printf("max value of unsigned long longs:  %30lld\n", ULLONG_MAX);

  printf("min value of signed long longs:    %30lld\n", LLONG_MIN);
  printf("max value of signed long longs:    %30lld\n", LLONG_MAX);
  return 0;
}
```

## 2.3 Constants

specifying type in constants:

```c
#define INT_NUMBER 1337
#define LONG_NUMBER 42l or 42L
#define UNSIGNED_LONG_NUMBER 42ul or 42UL
#define FLOAT_NUMBER 42.1337f or 42.1337F
#define FLOAT_NUMBER 42.1337lf or 42.1337LF // indicates long double
#define HEX_NUMBER 0x1f or 0x1F
```

Constants should be evaluated in compilation not inn run time.

Strings is a sequence of zero or more characters surrounded by double quotes

you should notice `"x"` is not `'x'`

- `"x"`: is an array of chars first character is `x` and second one is null `\0`.
- `'x'`: this is an integers used to represent the value of x in ascii

Enumeration is one of the way to make multiple constants more meaning full

```c
#include <stdio.h>

enum Days {Sun = 1, Mon = 2, Tue = 3, Wed = 4, Thu = 5, Fri = 6, Sat = 7};

int main(void)
{
	// today
	enum Days today = Sun;

	if (today == Sun || today == Sat)
	{
		printf("Yay it's Weekend\n");
	}
	else
	{
		printf("Time for some work\n");
	}
	return 0;
}

```

enums helps us to create multiple constants and represent them by their category for example

- Traffic Light
- Month Names
- etc

## 2.4 Declarations

all variables should be declared before any usage .

we can declare a variable then initialize it or we can do both at the same time

```c
// declare a variable then initialize
int foo;
foo = 1337;

// variable initialized in its declaration
int foo = 1337;
```

The qualifier const can be applied to the declaration of any variable to specify that its value
will not be changed. For an array, the const qualifier says that the elements will not be
altered.

```c
const double e = 2.71828182845905;
const char msg[] = "warning: ";
```

we also can use `const` with arguments to indicates that function do not change argument

```c
int strlen(const char[]);
```

Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void change_int(const int foo);

int main(void)
{
        const int foo = 40;
        change_int(foo);
        return 0;
}

void change_int(const int foo)
{
        bar = 50;
        printf("is this even working: %d\n", foo);
}
```

Output:

```c
╰─ gcc const.c -o const
const.c:14:2: error: use of undeclared identifier 'bar'
        bar = 50;
        ^
1 error generated.

```

## 2.5 Arithmetic Operators

## 2.6 Relational and Logical Operators

### Exercise 2-2

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_LENGTH 20
// question Exercise 2-2. Write a loop equivalent to the for loop above without using && or ||.
// for (i=0; i < lim-1 && (c=getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF; ++i)
// 	s[i] = c;

int main(void)
{
	int i, c;
	char s[MAX_LENGTH];

	for (i = 0; i < MAX_LENGTH - 1; ++i)
	{
		c = getchar();
		if (c == '\n')
		{
			i = MAX_LENGTH;
		}
		else if (c == EOF)
		{
			i = MAX_LENGTH;
		}
		else
		{
			s[i] = c;
		}
	}
	s[i] = '\0';
	return 0;
}

```

## 2.7 Type Conversions

If either operand is long double, convert the other to long double.

- Otherwise, if either operand is double, convert the other to double.
- Otherwise, if either operand is float, convert the other to float.
- Otherwise, convert char and short to int.
- Then, if either operand is long, convert the other to long.

Type casting is way to convert a type to another type in C it’s automatic like

```c
double foo = 9.5;
int bar = foo; // this is casting
```

this is equivalent to

```c
double foo = 9.5;
int bar = (int) foo; // -> this is the casting
```

casting can also help the function to get the right argument type for example

the function `sqrt` from `math.h` is a function that produce a double output but obviously, it can take multiple types argument such as like int double short and more but we can type cast them in the beginning like this

```c
sqrt((double) n) // this is in definition

// definition of double in math.h
double sqrt(double __x) { return __ocml_sqrt_f64(__x); }
//   casting╯
```

### Exercise 2-3

Write a function htoi(s), which converts a string of hexadecimal digits
(including an optional 0x or 0X) into its equivalent integer value. The allowable digits are 0
through 9, a through f, and A through F.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int htoi(const char s[]);

int main(void)
{
	printf("value of htoi: %d\n", htoi("-0x1F")); // -> -31
	printf("value of htoi: %d\n", htoi("0x1F"));  // -> 31
	return 0;
}

int htoi(const char s[])
{
	int signe;
	signe = 1;

	int string_length;
	string_length = 0;

	int i, r;
	i = r = 0;

	// get length of given string
	while(s[string_length] != '\0')
		++string_length;

	// if negative number
	if (s[0] == '-')
	{

		if (string_length < 4 || (s[1] != '0' && tolower(s[2]) != 'x'))
		{
			return -1;
		}
		else
		{
			signe = -1;
		}
	}

	// if string is less then 3 or doesn't have 0x or 0X in it.
	else if (string_length < 3 || (s[0] != '0' && tolower(s[1]) != 'x'))
	{
		return -1;
	}

	// current string is a hex number.
	for (i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; ++i)
	{
		// checking for number
		if (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9')
		{
			r = (r * 16) + s[i] - '0';
		}
		// checking for a digit to lower wouldn't efeect a number character 1 would be 1 by A wouldb be a.
		char lower_character = tolower(s[i]);

		if (lower_character >= 'a' && lower_character <= 'f')
		{
			// add 10 because a has a value of 10 in hex
			r = (r * 16) + (lower_character - 'a') + 10;

		}

	}

	return signe * r;
}

```

## 2.8 Increment and Decrement Operators

prefix : `++variable;`

postfix: `variable++;`

### Exercise 2-4

Write an alternative version of squeeze(s1,s2) that deletes each character in
s1 that matches any character in the string s2.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char * squeeze(char s1[], const char s2[]);

int main(void)
{
	char baz[4] = "helb";
	char bar[3] = "hel";

	char *foo = squeeze(baz, bar);
	printf("%c\n", foo[0]);
	return 0;
}

char * squeeze(char s1[], const char s2[])
{
	int length = 0;
	for (int i = 0; s1[i] != '\0'; i++)
		lenght++;

	// new array
	char new_string[length + 1];

	int i, new_string_index;
	i = new_string_index = 0;

	while(s1[i] != '\0')
	{
		int is_letter_found = -1;
		for (int j = 0; s2[j] != '\0'; j++)
		{
			if (s1[i] == s2[j])
			{
				is_letter_found = 0;
				break;
			}

		}
		if (is_letter_found == -1)
		{
			// assign not found letter in new-string and increment it't index
			new_string[new_string_index++] = s1[i];
		}

		i++;
	}
	new_string[new_string_index] = '\0';
	return new_string;

}

```

### Exercise 2-5

Write the function any(s1,s2), which returns the first location in a string s1
where any character from the string s2 occurs, or -1 if s1 contains no characters from s2.
(The standard library function strpbrk does the same job but returns a pointer to the
location.)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int any(const char s1[], const char s2[]);

int main(void)
{
        char baz[4] = "help";
        char bar[3] = "help";

        int foo = squeeze(baz, bar);
        printf("%d\n", foo);
        return 0;
}

int any(const char s1[], const char s2[])
{
        for (int i = 0; s1[i] != '\0'; i++)
        {
                for (int j = 0; s2[j] != '\0'; j++)
                {
                        if (s1[i] == s2[j])
                        {
                                return i;
                        }

                }

        }
        return -1;
}

```

## 2.9 Bitwise Operators

# what is Bitwise manipulation?

using bitwise operators you can manipulate bits in C

I don't get this :) .

## 2.10 Assignment Operators and Expressions

### Exercise 2-9

In a two's complement number system, x &= (x-1) deletes the rightmost 1-bit
in x. Explain why. Use this observation to write a faster version of bitcount.

I'll explain why `x &= (x-1)` deletes the rightmost 1-bit in a two's complement number

system, and then use this concept to develop a faster version of the `bitcount` function.

**Explanation:**

1. **Subtracting 1:** Subtracting 1 from a binary number flips all bits from (and including) the rightmost 1-bit to the left, until the least significant bit (LSB). For example:
   - `x = 1011 (decimal 11)`
   - `x - 1 = 1010 (decimal 10)`
2. **Bitwise AND (x & (x-1)):** When you perform a bitwise AND operation between `x` and `x-1`, the following happens:
   - Bits that are 1 in both `x` and `x-1` (all bits except the rightmost 1 in `x`) result in a 1 after the AND.
   - The rightmost 1-bit in `x` and the flipped 0-bit in `(x-1)` at that same position result in a 0 after the AND. This effectively clears the rightmost 1-bit in `x`.

**Example:**

Let's see how this works with the example from step 1:

- `x = 1011 (decimal 11)`
- `x - 1 = 1010 (decimal 10)`
- `x & (x-1) = 1010 (decimal 10)`

As you can see, the rightmost 1-bit in `x` (1011) has been cleared, resulting in 1010.

**Faster bitcount function:**

We can use this property to create a more efficient `bitcount` function that counts the number of set (1) bits in a number. Here's the approach:

1. Initialize a counter variable `count` to 0.
2. While `x` is not zero (i.e., there are still set bits):
   - Perform `x &= (x-1)`, effectively clearing the rightmost 1-bit in `x`.
   - Increment the `count` to indicate one set bit has been processed.
3. Return the final value of `count`, which represents the total number of set bits in the original `x`.

Here's the C code for the faster `bitcount` function:

**C**

`int bitcount_fast(unsigned x) {
  int count = 0;
  while (x) {
    x &= (x - 1);
    count++;
  }
  return count;
}`

**Use code [with caution.](https://gemini.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**

This approach is faster than a loop that iterates through each bit and checks if it's set because it leverages the bitwise operations to efficiently isolate and clear the rightmost 1-bit in each iteration.

## 2.11 Conditional Expressions

The ternary operator works the same as `if` `else` condition flow.

### Exercise 2-10

Rewrite the function lower, which converts upper case letters to lower case,
with a conditional expression instead of if-else

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char lower(char letter);
int main(void)
{
	char my_upper = 'A';
	printf("%c\n", lower(my_upper));

	char foo = 'F';
	printf("%c\n", lower(foo));
}

//
char lower(char letter)
{
	return (letter >= 'A' && letter <= 'Z') ? letter + 32: letter;
}

```

## 2.12 Precedence and Order of Evaluation

```c
Operators Associativity
() [] -> .                        left to right
! ~ ++ -- + - * (type) sizeof     right to left
* / %                             left to right
+ -                               left to right
<< >>                             left to right
< <= > >=                         left to right
== !=                             left to right
&                                 left to right
^                                 left to right
|                                 left to right
&&                                left to right
||                                left to right
?:                                right to left
= += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= right to left
,                                 left to right
```

The moral is that writing code that depends on order of evaluation is a bad programming
practice in any language.

the order in which function arguments are evaluated is not specified, so the
statement

```c
printf("%d %d\n", ++n, power(2, n)); /* WRONG */
```

can produce different results with different compilers, depending on whether n is incremented
before power is called. The solution, of course, is to write

```c
++n;
printf("%d %d\n", n, power(2, n));
```

# Chapter 3 - Control Flow

## 3.3 Else if

### Exercise 3-1

Our binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when one would suffice (at
the price of more tests outside.) Write a version with only one test inside the loop and
measure the difference in run-time.

```c
#include  <stdio.h>

int binsearch(const int x, const int v[], int n);

int main(void)
{
	int x = 0;
	int bar[7] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
	int n = 7;

	int result;

	result = binsearch(x, bar, n);
	printf("value is: %d\n", result); // value is -1
	return 0;
}

int binsearch(const int x, const int v[], int n)
{
	int low, high, mid;

	low = 0;
	high = n - 1;

	while (low < high) {
		mid = (low + high) / 2;
		if (x <= v[mid]) {
			high = mid;
		}
		else {
			low = mid + 1;
		}
	}

	return (v[mid] == x) ? mid : -1;
}

```

## 3.4 Switch

The `switch` operator serve the same purpose of `if......else if......else`

it't structured like this:

```c
switch (expression) {
	case const-expr:
		statements
	case const-expr:
		statements
	default:
		statements
}
```

for example this is a basic program i wrote about traffic lights:

```c
    1 #include <stdio.h>
    2
    3 enum TRAFFIC_LIGHT {RED = 0, YELLOW = 1, GREEN = 2};·
    4
    5 int main(void)
    6 {
    7 »       int current_light = 0;
    8
    9 »       // switch·
   10 »       switch (current_light) {
   11 »       »       case RED :·
   12 »       »       »       printf("current light is red\n");
   13 »       »       »       break;
   14 »       »       case GREEN :·
   15 »       »       »       printf("current light is green\n");
   16 »       »       »       break;
   17 »       »       default :·
   18 »       »       »       printf("current light is red\n");
   19 »       »       »       break;
   20 »       }
   21 »       return 0;
   22 }

```

the `break` statement insure breaking from the case after executing the program without the it would execute all print statement.

`break` helps breaking from `switch for while do while` .

### Exercise 3-2

Write a function escape(s,t) that converts characters like newline and tab
into visible escape sequences like \n and \t as it copies the string t to s. Use a switch. Write
a function for the other direction as well, converting escape sequences into the real characters.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void escape(const char string[], char new_string[]);

/*
Exercise 3-2. Write a function escape(s,t) that converts characters like newline and tab
into visible escape sequences like \n and \t as it copies the string t to s. Use a switch. Write
a function for the other direction as well, converting escape sequences into the real characters.
*/

int main(void)
{
	char s1[15] = "Hello, \\World!\n";
	char s2[30];

	// convert new string.
	escape(s1, s2);

	// print convert string.
	printf("%s", s2);
	return 0;
}

void escape(const char string[], char new_string[])
{
	int new_string_index, i;
	new_string_index = 0;

	for (i = 0; string[i] != '\0'; i++) {
		switch (string[i]) {
			// i'm to lazy to do all escaping but i get the idea :)
			case '\n':
			// for new line.
				new_string[new_string_index++] = '\\';
				new_string[new_string_index++] = 'n';
				break;
			case '\t':
			// for tab.
				new_string[new_string_index++] = '\\';
				new_string[new_string_index++] = 't';
				break;
			case '\\':
			// for slash.
				new_string[new_string_index++] = '\\';
				new_string[new_string_index++] = '\\';
				break;
			default:
			// for all character.
				new_string[new_string_index++] = string[i];
		}
	}
	new_string[i] = '\0';
}

```

This is not all the solution i didn't include all escaping characters.

## 3.5 Loops - While and For

loops are one of the essentials in any programing language

1. The `for` statement

   ```c
   for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
   	statement
   ```

2. is equivalent to using `while`

   ```c
   expr1;
   while (expr2) {
   	statement
   	expr3;
   }
   ```

### Exercise 3-3

Write a function expand(s1,s2) that expands shorthand notations like a-z in
the string s1 into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2. Allow for letters of either
case and digits, and be prepared to handle cases like a-b-c and a-z0-9 and -a-z. Arrange
that a leading or trailing - is taken literally.

```c
/*

  and a-z0-9 and -a-z. Arrange that a leading or trailing - is taken literally.

  input: a-z output: abcd......xyz
  input: a-z0-9 output:  abcd......xyz012..789

*/
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_LENGTH 100

void expand(const char s1[], char s2[]);

int main(void) {
  char s1[MAX_LENGTH] = "a-b-c";
  char s2[MAX_LENGTH];

  expand(s1, s2);

  printf("%s\n", s2);
  return 0;
}

void expand(const char s1[], char s2[]) {

  // get s1 length.
  int length;
  for (length = 0; s1[length] != '\0'; lenght++) {
  }

  if (length < 3) {
    printf("invalid input\n");
    return;
  }

  int i, j;
  j = 0;

  int start, end;
  start = end = -1;

  for (i = 0; s1[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    if (s1[i] != '-') {
      if (start == -1) {
        start = s1[i];
      } else if (end == -1) {
        end = s1[i];
      }
    } else {
    }

    // start copying
    if (end != -1) {
      int temp = start;
      while (temp != end) {
        s2[j++] = temp++;
      }
      // assign the last letter.
      s2[j++] = temp;
      start = end = -1;

    }
    // if a-b-c case
    else if (start != -1 && s1[i + 1] == '\0') {
      s2[j++] = start;
      start = end = -1;
    }
  }
}

```

## 3.6 Loops - Do-While

previously we knew that `for` and `while` test the termination condition at the top but, the `do while` loop which is the same as the `while` loop but make the termination test after executing in the bottom.

It's syntax is like this:

```c
do
	statement
while (expression);
```

The statement get executed then expression is evaluated if `true` continue if `false` it stops.

Technically the `do while` loop is not used after rater than `for` `while` .

Here is an example of a function `itoa` which convert integer to ascii, it's the alternative of `atoi`.

**The job is slightly more complicated than might be thought at first, because the easy methods of generating the digits generate them in the wrong order. We have chosen to generate the string backwards, then reverse it**

```c
/* itoa: convert n to characters in s */
void itoa(int n, char s[])
{
	int i, sign;
	if ((sign = n) < 0) /* record sign */
		n = -n; /* make n positive */
	i = 0;
	do { /* generate digits in reverse order */
		s[i++] = n % 10 + '0'; /* get next digit */
	} while ((n /= 10) > 0); /* delete it */

	if (sign < 0)
		s[i++] = '-';
	s[i] = '\0';
	reverse(s);
}
```

`itoa` is a challenge for beginners i tried re write it and understand it.

i avoid using pointers since the book until now didn't cover them that is why i used `temp_string`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define EXIT_SUCCESS 0
void reverse(char string[], char new_string[]);
void itoa(int n, char string[]);

int main(void) {
  int number = -200;
  char ascii_number[20];

  // convert intever to string ascii number
  itoa(number, ascii_number);

  // printing the converted number
  printf("This is the number: %d = %s\n", number, ascii_number);
  // without reversing the string output of -200 should be 002-

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

void itoa(int n, char string[]) {
  char temp_string[20];
  int i, sign;

  // get sing from number
  // if number is less then 0, make it positive.
  if ((sign = n) < 0) {
    n = -n;
  }

  i = 0;
  do {
    temp_string[i++] = n % 10 + '0';
  } while ((n = n / 10) > 0);

  // add sing if number is negative
  if (sign < 0) {
    temp_string[i++] = '-';
  }
  temp_string[i] = '\0';

  // all you need to do now is to reverse the string
  reverse(temp_string, string);
  return;
}

void reverse(char string[], char new_string[]) {
  /*
    i only thing of one algo is to count length of string
    and terevce it using that length.
  */

  // calculate string length.
  int length;
  for (length = 0; string[length] != '\0'; lenght++)
    ;

  int j = 0;
  for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--, j++) {
    new_string[j] = string[i];
  }
  new_string[j] = '\0';
  return;
}

```

### Exercise 3-4

In a two's complement number representation, our version of itoa does not handle the largest negative number, that is, the value of n equal to -(2ˆ(wordsize-1)). Explain why
not. Modify it to print that value correctly, regardless of the machine on which it runs.

```c
/*
since the itoa function accept integer as parameter that is why it can't handle long negative number because int is just 4 bytes to handle long negaitve number we can use long integers or long long integers. 8 or 10 bytes.
============
That is my take i could be wrong :)
it's indeed memorry buffer overflow i had to convert the number from long long to unsigned long long so it can store more positive values after converting it.
*/
```

The new code would be like this

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define EXIT_SUCCESS 0
void reverse(char string[], char new_string[]);
void itoa(long long n, char string[]);

int main(void) {
  long long number = -20000000000000000;
  char ascii_number[200];

  // convert intever to string ascii number
  itoa(number, ascii_number);

  // printing the converted number
  printf("This is the number: %lld = %s\n", number, ascii_number);
  // without reversing the string output of -200 should be 002-

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

void itoa(long long n, char string[]) {
  char temp_string[200];
  int i;
  long long sign;

  // get sing from number
  // if number is less then 0, make it positive.
  if ((sign = n) < 0) {
    n = -n;
  }

  // why n is negative ??????
  unsigned long long current_number = n;
  i = 0;
  do {
    temp_string[i++] = current_number % 10 + '0';
  } while ((current_number = current_number / 10) > 0);

  // add sing if number is negative
  if (sign < 0) {
    temp_string[i++] = '-';
  }
  temp_string[i] = '\0';

  // all you need to do now is to reverse the string
  reverse(temp_string, string);
  return;
}

void reverse(char string[], char new_string[]) {
  /*
    i only thing of one algo is to count length of string
    and terevce it using that length.
  */

  // calculate string length.
  int length;
  for (length = 0; string[length] != '\0'; lenght++)
    ;

  int j = 0;
  for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--, j++) {
    new_string[j] = string[i];
  }
  new_string[j] = '\0';
  return;
}

```

### Exercise 3-5

Write the function `itob(n, s, b)` that converts the integer n into a base b character representation in the string s. In particular, `itob(n, s, 16)` formats s as a hexadecimal integer in s.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void itob(long long number, char string[], int base);
/*
  Exercise 3-5. Write the function itob(n,s,b) that converts the integer n into

*/
void reverse(char temp_string[], char new_string[]);

int main(void) {

  long long number = 157;

  char string_number[200];
  int base = 8;

  // convert number to it's base
  itob(number, string_number, base);
  printf("number is: %lld = %s\n", number, string_number);
  return 0;
}

/*
  I'm going to use just the bases in the man helper
  we have:
    - octal
    - hex

  I'm not gonna do the binary case i just don't
*/
void itob(long long number, char string[], int base) {
  char temp_string[200];

  // check if number is negative.
  long long sign;
  if ((sign = number) < 0) {
    number *= -1;
  }
  unsigned long long current_number = number;

  int i = 0;
  do {
    temp_string[i++] = current_number % base + '0';

  } while ((current_number = (unsigned long long)current_number / base) > 0);

  // add hex prefixer
  if (base == 16) {
    temp_string[i++] = 'x';
    temp_string[i++] = '0';
  } else if (base == 8) {
    temp_string[i++] = 'o';
    temp_string[i++] = '0';
  }
  temp_string[i] = '\0';
  reverse(temp_string, string);

  return;
}

void reverse(char temp_string[], char new_string[]) {
  // calculate string length.
  int length;
  for (length = 0; temp_string[length] != '\0'; lenght++)
    ;
  // declare a temp array

  int j = 0;
  for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--, j++) {
    new_string[j] = temp_string[i];
  }
  new_string[j] = '\0';
  return;
}
```

### Exercise 3-6

Write a version of itoa that accepts three arguments instead of two. The third
argument is a minimum field width; the converted number must be padded with blanks on the
left if necessary to make it wide enough.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define EXIT_SUCCESS 0
void reverse(char string[], char new_string[]);
void itoa(long long n, char string[], int width);

int main(void) {
  long long number = -200000000;
  char ascii_number[200];

  // convert intever to string ascii number
  itoa(number, ascii_number, 10);

  // printing the converted number
  printf("This is the number: %lld = %s\n", number, ascii_number);
  // without reversing the string output of -200 should be 002-

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

void itoa(long long n, char string[], int width) {
  char temp_string[200];
  int i;
  long long sign;

  // get sing from number
  // if number is less then 0, make it positive.
  if ((sign = n) < 0) {
    n = -n;
  }

  // why n is negative ??????
  unsigned long long current_number = n;
  i = 0;
  do {
    temp_string[i++] = current_number % 10 + '0';
  } while ((current_number = current_number / 10) > 0);

  // add sing if number is negative
  if (sign < 0) {
    temp_string[i++] = '-';
  }

  // add widths
  int end_width_index = width + i;
  for (; i < end_width_index; i++) {
    temp_string[i] = ' ';
  }
  temp_string[i] = '\0';

  // all you need to do now is to reverse the string
  reverse(temp_string, string);

  return;
}

void reverse(char string[], char new_string[]) {
  /*
    i only thing of one algo is to count length of string
    and terevce it using that length.
  */

  // calculate string length.
  int length;
  for (length = 0; string[length] != '\0'; length++)
    ;

  int j = 0;
  for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--, j++) {
    new_string[j] = string[i];
  }
  new_string[j] = '\0';
  return;
}

output is:
╰─ ./itoa2
This is the number: -200000000 =           -200000000

```

## 3.7 Break and Continue

`break` statement breaks from a loop

`continue` ignores the current index and continue

## 3.8 Got and labels

This is the first time i have heard about `Goto` , it's like a `break` statement but, there is a bit difference:

- break: break out of the current loop
  Ex:

  ```c
     1   #include <stdio.h>
     1
     2   int main(void) {
     3   │ char foo[10] = "0000110000";
     4   │
     5   │ // break
     6   │ for (int i = 0; foo[i] != '\0'; i++) {
     7   │ │ if (foo[i] == '1') {
     8   │ │ │ break;
     9   │ │ }
    10   │ }
    11   │

  ```

- goto just get out of all existing loops that are inside
  Ex:
  ```c
    12   │ for (int i = 0; foo[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    13   │ │ for (;;) {
    14   │ │ │ goto huh;
    15   │ │ }
    16   │ │ if (foo[i] == '1') {
    17   │ │ │ break;
    18   │ │ }
    19   │ }
    20   huh:
    21   │ printf("what even is this)";
    22   │

# Chapter 4 - Functions and Program Structure

### 4.1 Basics of Functions

function helps us break a big code to smaller block of codes to easily deal with.

each function definition has the form of

```c
return-type function-name(argument declarations)
{
	declarations and statements
}
```

this is a break down of the `strindex` function

```c
/* strindex: return index of t in s, -1 if none */
int strindex(char s[], char t[])
{
	int i, j, k;

	// iterate over the string s until end
	for (i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) {

		// in every character of string s loop over the string t until end of t and each character of t is equal to s
		for (j=i, k=0; t[k]!='\0' && s[j]==t[k]; j++, k++)
			;

		if (k > 0 && t[k] == '\0')
			return i;
	}
return -1;
}
```

in function if the return type is omitted the return type by default in this case is `int`

In a case of this example

```c
int foo(void)
{
	// no return statement
]
```

in this case if there is no return statement aka a function that should return something, it didn't

it's value certain to be garbage.

### Exercise 4-1

Write the function `strindex(s,t)` which returns the position of the rightmost occurrence of t in s, or -1 if there is none.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// function declaration
int strindex(const char s[], const char t[]);
int get_length(const char s[]);

int main(void) {

  const char s[] = "hello world";
  const char t[] = "world";

  int result = strindex(s, t);

  if (result != -1) {
    printf("'%s' found at index %d in '%s'\n", t, result, s);
  } else {
    printf("'%s' not found in '%s'\n", t, s);
  }

  return 0;
}

int strindex(const char s[], const char t[]) {
  // get strings length
  int s_length = get_length(s);
  int t_length = get_length(t);

  int i, j, k;
  int index = -1;

  for (i = s_length - t_length; i > 0; i--) {
    for (j = i, k = 0; t[k] == s[j] && t[k] != '\0'; j++, k++)
      ;

    if (t[k] == '\0' && k > 0) {
      index = i;
    }
  }
  return index;
}

int get_length(const char s[]) {
  int length;

  for (length = 0; s[length] != '\0'; lenght++)
    ;

  return length;
}
```

Output:

```bash
'world' found at index 6 in 'hello world'
```

### 4.2 Functions Returning Non-integers

`atof.c`

```c
/*
  sum += atof(line) for first look of the atof function we have no idea what
  type it returns so we assume it's an int plus we don't know nothing about it's
  argument no information

  for example this function **double atof()**
  if we look at it we would know that this function doesn't take any arguments
  at all, but in the modern C we use the void keyword to diterman that so use
  void

  Example:
  // atoi: convert string s to integer using atof
  // notice that we cast the return statement to the type of the function before
  it's taken.
  int atoi(char s[]) {
    double atof(char s[]);
    return (int) atof(s);
  }

*/

#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAXLINE 100

// %g is an equalifier for double

int main(void) {
  double sum, atof(const char[]);
  char line[MAXLINE] = "44444.323323254523";

  printf("%g\n", atof(line));
  sum = 0;
  return 0;
}

/*
  so the function convert ascii to floating point number
  it's the same as atoi but we add the part of the floating points after the .
  in the part after the condition for the .
  for example if we have as input "20.4"
  we would get 20 we check for the dot and skip it.
  for the 4 it's the same put we add the power variable so we would get
    - val = 204
    - power = 10
  then divide 204 by the 10 and you would get 20.4
  and voila
*/
double atof(const char string[]) {
  int i, sign;
  double val, power;

  // skip white spaces
  for (i = 0; string[i] == ' '; i++)
    ;

  // check for the sign
  sign = (string[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1;
  if (string[i] == '+' || string[i] == '-')
    i++;

  // start iterating
  for (val = 0.0; isdigit(string[i]); i++)
    val = val * 10 + (string[i] - '0');

  if (string[i] == '.')
    i++;

  for (power = 1.0; isdigit(string[i]); i++) {
    val = val * 10 + (string[i] - '0');
    power *= 10;
  }

  return sign * val / power;
}

// output is this 44444.3 IDK why?

```

### Exercise 4-2

Extend `atof` to handle scientific notation of the form `123.45e-6`

```c
// i just don't get the idea how this works plus the why it prints the number uncomplite cuz of the quantifier %g should be %f
/*
  sum += atof(line) for first look of the atof function we have no idea what
  type it returns so we assume it's an int plus we don't know nothing about it's
  argument no information

  for example this function **double atof()**
  if we look at it we would know that this function doesn't take any arguments
  at all, but in the modern C we use the void keyword to diterman that so use
  void

  Example:
  // atoi: convert string s to integer using atof
  // notice that we cast the return statement to the type of the function before
  it's taken.
  int atoi(char s[]) {
    double atof(char s[]);
    return (int) atof(s);
  }

*/

#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAXLINE 100

// %g is an equalifier for double

int main(void) {
  double sum, atof(const char[]);
  char line[MAXLINE] = "44444.323323254523";

  printf("%f\n", atof(line));
  return 0;
}

/*
  so the function convert ascii to floating point number

    - power = 10

  and voila
*/
double atof(const char string[]) {
  int i, sign;
  double val, power;

  // skip white spaces
  for (i = 0; string[i] == ' '; i++)
    ;

  // check for the sign
  sign = (string[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1;
  if (string[i] == '+' || string[i] == '-')
    i++;

  // start iterating
  for (val = 0.0; isdigit(string[i]); i++)
    val = val * 10.0 + (string[i] - '0');

  if (string[i] == '.')
    i++;

  for (power = 1.0; isdigit(string[i]); i++) {
    val = val * 10.0 + (string[i] - '0');
    power *= 10;
  }
  // printf("wtf is this: %f\n", sign * val / power);
  return sign * val / power;
}

```

## 4.4 Scope Rules

for programs that are getting bigger it's good practice to divide them to smaller pieces such definition in one place and declaration in other

for example :

```c
in file1:
	extern int sp;
	extern double val[];
	void push(double f) { ... }
	double pop(void) { ... }

in file2:
	int sp = 0;
	double val[MAXVAL];
```

## 4.5 Header Files

The previous calculator program would be divided like this

![Screenshot 2024-05-04 at 17.17.40.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9993905c-51b5-4b76-bff2-778e9ef69272/750ac9be-e53a-4c7c-81e5-1fdafd92eeef/Screenshot_2024-05-04_at_17.17.40.png)

## 4.6 Static Variables

`static` variable can only be used in the in the scope where it got defined.

so a `static global` variable con only be used in a file where which is defined.

so for example in the code `getch.c`

```c
static char buf[BUFSIZE]; /* buffer for ungetch */
static int bufp = 0; /* next free position in buf */

int getch(void) { ... }
void ungetch(int c) { ... }
```

the tow variables `buf and bufp` wouldn't be accessible outside of the file.

`static` is most often used to function either, the function it self is global it self but, using the `static` key word it would only accessible in ht current file

### Exercise 4-11

Modify `getop` so that it doesn't need to use `ungetch`. Hint: use an internal
`static` variable.

just add static to variables used in `ungetch` and put them in the condition of `getop`

```c
static int pb_char = '\0';
static int pb_flag = 0;

int getop(char s[]) {
  int i, c;
  int sign_flag = 0;
  while ((s[0] = c = getch()) == ' ' || c == '\t')
    ;
  s[1] = '\0';
  if (!isdigit(c) && c != '.' && c != '-' && c != '+') {
    return c;
  }
  i = 0;
  if (c == '-' || c == '+') {
    char temp = c;
    c = getch();
    if (isdigit(c)) {
      s[++i] = c;
    } else {
      return temp;
    }
  }
  if (isdigit(c)) {
    while (isdigit(s[++i] = c = getch()))
      ;
  }
  if (c == '.') {
    while (isdigit(s[++i] = c = getch()))
      ;
  }
  s[i] = '\0';
  if (c != EOF) {
    pb_char = c;
    pb_flag = 1;
  }
  return NUMBER;
}

int getch(void) { return (pb_flag == 1) ? pb_flag = 0, pb_char : getchar(); }

```

## 4.7 Register Variables

`register` advice the compiler that the variable is going to be user heavily will be user in this program

## 4.10 Recursion

The `static` key work helps a lot in recursive function it allows to set a global variables for all function scopes

### Exercise 4-12.

Adapt the ideas of `printd` to write a recursive version of `itoa`; that is, convert an integer into a string by calling a recursive routine.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define MAXVALUE 100

void itoa(int number, char nstring[]);

int main(void) {
  const int number = -200;
  char nstring[MAXVALUE];
  itoa(number, nstring);
  printf("This is the value of number: %s\n", nstring);
}

/*
  itoa recursive
  - input : int
  - output: char[]
*/
void itoa(int number, char nstring[]) {

  static int i = 0;

  if (number / 10) {
    itoa(number / 10, nstring);
  } else {
    i = 0;
    if (number < 0) {
      nstring[i++] = '-';
    }
  }

  nstring[i++] = (number % 10) * -1 + '0';
  nstring[i] = '\0';
}

```

### Exercise 4-13.

Write a recursive version of the function reverse(s), which reverses the string s in place

This is simple but it makes me go wield just to say

```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAXLENGHT 100

void reverse(char s[], char news[]);

int main(void) {
  char s[] = ".esrever rof tset elpmis a si sihT";
  char new_s[strlen(s)];

  char t[] = "KO";
  char new_t[strlen(t)];

  printf("Reversing '%s': ", s);
  reverse(s, new_s);
  printf("%s\n", new_s);

  printf("Reversing '%s': ", t);
  reverse(t, new_t);
  printf("%s\n", new_t);

  return 0;
}

void reverse(char s[], char news[]) {
  static int i = 0;

  if (strlen(s) < 2)
    return;

  if (s[0] != '\0') {
    reverse(s + 1, news);
    news[i++] = s[0];
  }
}

```

## 4.11 The C Preprocessor

C provides certain language facilities by means of a preprocessor, which is conceptionally a
separate first step in compilation. The two most frequently used features are:

- `#include` to include the contents of a file during compilation.
- `#define`, to replace a token by an arbitrary sequence of characters.
- Other features described in this section include conditional compilation and macros with arguments.

### 4.11.1 File Inclusion

File inclusion makes it easy to handle collections of `#defines`and declarations (among other things). Any source line of the form:

```c
#include "filename"

// or

#include <filename>
```

is replaced by the contents of the file filename.

If the filename is quoted, searching for the file typically begins where the source program was found.

if it is not found there, or if the name is enclosed in `< and >` searching follows an implementation-defined rule to find the file.

An included file may itself contain #include lines.

### 4.11.2 Macro Substitution

```c
#define FOO "This is a long string fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo \
							Now i'm finishing the string in the next line fooooooooo\n"
```

Using `\` i have continued the definition onto several lines

Any name may be defined with any replacement text. For example

```c
#define forever for (;;) /* infinite loop */
```

now forever is infinite loop.

It is also possible to define macros with arguments, so the replacement text can be different
for different calls of the macro. As an example, define a macro called max:

```c
#define max(A, B) ((A) > (B) ? (A) : (B))
```

it's like a function but this expands into line code. for example

```c
x = max((p + q), (r + s));
```

will be replaced by the line

```c
x = ((p + q) > (r + s) ? (p + q) : (r + s));
```

So long as the arguments are treated consistently, this macro will serve for any data type;
there is no need for different kinds of max for different data types, as there would be with
functions.

If you examine the expansion of max, you will notice some pitfalls. The expressions are
evaluated twice; this is bad if they involve side effects like increment operators or input and
output. For instance

```c
max(i++, j++) /* WRONG */

#define square(x) x * x /* WRONG */
is invoked as square(z+1).
```

Names may be undefined with `#undef`, usually to ensure that a routine is really a function, not a macro:

```c
#undef getchar
int getchar(void) { ... }
```

Formal parameters are not replaced within quoted strings. If, however, a parameter name is
preceded by a `#` in the replacement text, the combination will be expanded into a quoted string
with the parameter replaced by the actual argument. This can be combined with string
concatenation to make, for example, a debugging print macro:

```c
#define dprint(expr) printf(#expr " = %g\n", expr)
```

When this is invoked, as in, notice the `#expr` has been expanded into a quoted string

```c
dprint(x/y)
/* the macro is expanded into */

printf("x/y" " = &g\n", x/y);
/* and the strings are concatenated, so the effect is */

printf("x/y = &g\n", x/y);
```

The preprocessor operator ## provides a way to concatenate actual arguments during macro
expansion. If a parameter in the replacement text is adjacent to a `##`, the parameter is replaced
by the actual argument, the `## and surrounding white space are removed`, and the result is re-scanned. For example, the macro paste concatenates its two arguments for example:

```c
#define paste(front, back) front ## back

/* so paste(name, 1) creates the token name1. */
```

### Exercise 4-14.

Define a macro `swap(t, x, y)` that interchanges two arguments of type t.
(Block structure will help.)

i haven't understood this problem so i asked gbt to explain it to me:

> **Understanding the Macro**:
> The exercise asks you to define a macro named `swap` that will interchange two arguments of type `t`.
>
> 1. **Macro Syntax**:
>    In C programming, a macro is defined using the `#define` directive. It allows you to define a symbol or a snippet of code that gets replaced by a specified expression when it appears in the code. For this exercise, you'll be defining a macro named `swap`.
> 2. **Macro Arguments**:
>    The macro `swap` will take three arguments: `t`, `x`, and `y`. - `t` is a type specifier. This allows `swap` to be used with different data types. - `x` and `y` are the two variables whose values need to be interchanged.
> 3. **Interchanging the Values**:
>    The goal of the `swap` macro is to interchange the values of `x` and `y`. This means that whatever `x` holds initially will be swapped with the value of `y`, and vice versa.
> 4. **Block Structure**:
>    The exercise mentions that block structure will help. This suggests that you should encapsulate the operations of the macro within a block of code, using curly braces `{}`. This ensures that any temporary variables used within the macro don't interfere with other variables in the program.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define EXIT_SUCCESS 0
#define swap(t, x, y)                                                        \
  { t var_t = x, x = y, y = var_t; }

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int x = 20;
  int y = 30;

  printf("x is: %d\n", x);
  printf("y is: %d\n", y);
  swap(int, x, y);  // --> { t var_t = x, x = y, y = var_t; }  the t is going to be replaced by int
  printf("swapped x is: %d\n", x);
  printf("swapped y is: %d\n", y);

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

```c
╰─ ./a.out
x is: 20
y is: 30
swapped x is: 20
swapped y is: 30
```

### 4.11.3 Conditional Inclusion

It is possible to control preprocessing itself with conditional statements that are evaluated
during preprocessing. This provides a way to include code selectively, depending on the value of conditions evaluated during compilation

The `#if` line evaluates a constant integer expression (which may not include `sizeof`, `casts`, or`enum` constants), If the expression is non-zero, subsequent lines until an `#endif` or `#elif` or `#else` are included.

(The preprocessor statement `#elif` is like `else if ()` .) The expression `defined(name)` in a `#if` is 1 if the name has been defined, and 0 otherwise.

for example to make sure that the header file `hdr.h` is included only once the constants of the files are surrounded with a conditional like this:

```c
#if !defined(HDR)
#define HDR
/* contents of hdr.h go here */
#endif
```

if the `her.h` file is defined then it will skip the block until `#endif`

```c
#if SYSTEM == SYSV
#define HDR "sysv.h"
#elif SYSTEM == BSD
#define HDR "bsd.h"
#elif SYSTEM == MSDOS
#define HDR "msdos.h"
#else
#define HDR "default.h"
#endif
#include HDR
```

In this example we include a specific file based on the value of the `SYSTEM` .

This `#if !defined(HDR)` in the earlier example can be represented in a different way, so that block of code means that we check if HDR is not defined but we can do it like this: `#ifndef HDR` it's a bit pythonic `# if n def` also, there is `#ifdef HDR` and voila

```c
#if !defined(HDR)
#define HDR
/* contents of hdr.h go here */
#endif

// ==============

#ifndef HDR
#define HDR
/* contents of hdr.h go here */
#endif
```

# Chapter 5 - Pointers and Arrays

A pointer is a variable that it's value contains the address in the memory for Example:

```c
int bar = 50; // this is just a variable

int *foo = &bar // this is a pointer points to bars address
```

Pointer dereferencing allow to get the value of the of the pointed variable

```c
int newBarValue = (*foo)++;
printf("%d\n", newBarValue); // this would print 51
```

### Exercise 5-1.

}

```

## 5.3 Pointers and Arrays

In C Arrays and pointers share some points, so

`int a[10];` is an array with 10 elements inside it, in other hand `int *pa = &a[0];` is a pointer that points to the first element of the array.

![array.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9993905c-51b5-4b76-bff2-778e9ef69272/ee41a5bf-ec10-42c9-8d74-e5668ebeaf76/array.png)

By incrementing the pointer we can traverse the array `*(pa+1);`

There is one difference between an array name and a pointer that must be kept in mind. A
pointer is a variable, so `pa = a` and `pa++` are legal. But an array name is not a variable;
constructions like `a = pa` and `a++` are illegal.

When an array name is passed to a function, what is passed is the location of the initial
element. Within the called function, this argument is a local variable, and so an array name
parameter is a pointer, that is, a variable containing an address. We can use this fact to write
another version of strlen, which computes the length of a string.

![array&pointer.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9993905c-51b5-4b76-bff2-778e9ef69272/1063b9e9-fd5f-4e32-a7a8-44f7aae69d8b/arraypointer.png)

```c
/* strlen: return length of string s */
int strlen(char *s)
{
	int n;
	for (n = 0; *s != '\0', s++)
		n++;
	return n;
}
```

Since s is a pointer, incrementing it is perfectly legal; `s++` has no effect on the character string
in the function that called strlen, but merely increments strlen's private copy of the
pointer. That means that calls like

```c
strlen("hello, world"); /* string constant **/
strlen(array); /** char array[100]; **/*
strlen(ptr); /* char *ptr; */
```

all work.

As formal parameters in a function definition,
are equivalent; we prefer the latter because it says more explicitly that the variable is a
pointer. When an array name is passed to a function, the function can at its convenience

```c
char s[];
and
char *s;
```

believe that it has been handed either an `array or a pointer`, and manipulate it accordingly. It
can even use both notations if it seems appropriate and clear.
It is possible to pass part of an array to a function, by passing a pointer to the beginning of the
subarray. For example, if a is an array,

```c
f(&a[2])
and
f(a+2)
```

both pass to the function f the address of the subarray that starts at a[2]. Within f, the
parameter declaration can read
So as far as f is concerned, the fact that the parameter refers to part of a larger array is of no
consequence.

```c
f(int arr[]) { ... }
or
f(int *arr) { ... }
```

If one is sure that the elements exist, it is also possible to index backwards in an array; p[-1],
p[-2], and so on are syntactically legal, and refer to the elements that immediately precede
p[0]. Of course, it is illegal to refer to objects that are not within the array bounds.

## 5.4 Address Arithmetic

If p is a pointer to some element of an array, then `p++` increments p to point to the next
element, and `p += i` increments it to point i elements beyond where it currently does. These
and similar constructions are the simples forms of pointer or address arithmetic.

In this example we are going to implement a simple version of `malloc and free` function, the idea is to create an array only accessible to the tow function in the file using `sttic` key word where `alloc` allocate slots and returns a pointer and `afree` free slots from the given number

![alloc-afree.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9993905c-51b5-4b76-bff2-778e9ef69272/a1f877ca-9d87-467b-bbb0-b7ec50b88af8/alloc-afree.png)

```c
#define ALLOCSIZE 10000

char *alloc(int n);

static char allocbuff[ALLOCSIZE]; /* storage for allocation */
static char *allocp = allocbuff;  /* next free position */

char *alloc(int n) {

  if (allocbuff + ALLOCSIZE - allocp >= n) {
    allocp += n;       /* alloc n slots */
    return allocp - n; /* return the starting position of new allocation */
  }
  return 0;
}

void afree(char *p) {
  /*
   * p should be greater current index of buff and p less than full sizze of
   * allocbuff array
   */
  if (p >= allocbuff && p < allocbuff + ALLOCSIZE) {
    allocp = p;
  }
}

```

you can see in `alloc` we return 0 if there is no space left to alloc so in `C` zero for a pointer means `NULL`

```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>

size_t my_strlen(char *s);

int main(void) {
  int length = my_strlen("Hello, World!");
  printf("length of length : %d\n", length);

  return 0;
}

size_t my_strlen(char *s) {

  char *p = s;

  while (*p != '\0')
    p++;

  return p - s;
}

```

The valid pointer operations are assignment of pointers of the same type, adding or
subtracting a pointer and an integer, subtracting or comparing two pointers to members of the
same array, and assigning or comparing to zero. All other pointer arithmetic is illegal. It is not
legal to add two pointers, or to multiply or divide or shift or mask them, or to add float or
double to them, or even, except for void \*, to assign a pointer of one type to a pointer of
another type without a cast.

## 5.5 Character Pointers and Functions

- Example of `strcpy` using pointers

  ```c
  #include <string.h>
  #include <unistd.h>

  void my_strcpy(char *s, char *t);

  int main(void) {

    char *foo = "Hello, World!\n";
    char bar[14];

    my_strcpy(bar, foo);

    write(1, bar, strlen(foo));
    return 0;
  }

  void my_strcpy(char *s, char *t) {

    while ((*s++ = *t++)) /* redundant checking for '\0' */
      ;
  }

  /*
    This is a bit understandable
    strcpy: copy t to s; pointer version
    void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
    {
      int i;
      i = 0;
      while ((*s = *t) != '\0') {
        s++;
        t++;
      }
    }
   * */
  ```

- Example of `strcmp` using pointers

  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <unistd.h>

  int my_strcmp(char *s, char *t);

  int main(void) {

    char *foo = "Hello, World!\n";
    char *bar = "Hello, C Language!\n";

    return 0;
  }

  int my_strcmp(char *s, char *t) {

    for (; *s == *t; s++, t++) {
      if (*s == '\0') {
        return 0;
      }
    }
    return *s - *t;
  }

  /*
    This is a bit understandable
    strcmp: return <0 if s<t, 0 if s==t, >0 if s>t
    int strcmp(char *s, char *t)
    {
      int i;
      for (i = 0; s[i] == t[i]; i++)
        if (s[i] == '\0')
          return 0;
      return s[i] - t[i];
    }
   * */
  ```

### Exercise 5-3.

Write a pointer version of the function strcat that we showed in Chapter 2:
`strcat(s,t)` copies the string t to the end of `s`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

char *my_strcat(char *s, char *t);

int main(void) {

  char *foo = "Hello, World!\n";
  char *bar = "Is This Even The End!\n";

  char *foobar = my_strcat(foo, bar);

  printf("%s", foobar);

  return 0;
}

char *my_strcat(char *s, char *t) {

  int length_s = strlen(s);
  int length_t = strlen(t);

  char *new_strcat = malloc(sizeof(char) * (length_s + length_s + 1));
  char *new_strcatp = new_strcat;

  while (*s != '\0' && (*new_strcat++ = *s++))
    ;

  while ((*new_strcat++ = *t++))
    ;

  return new_strcatp;
}

```

### Exercise 5-4.

Write the function `strend(s,t)` which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the
end of the string s, and zero otherwise

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int my_strend(char *s, char *t);
int my_strcmp(char *s, char *t);

int main(void) {

  char *foo = "Hello, World!\n";
  char *bar = "World!\n";

  int is_end = my_strend(foo, bar);

  printf("%d\n", is_end);

  return 0;
}

int my_strend(char *s, char *t) {
  int s_length = strlen(s);
  int t_length = strlen(t);

  // set s to point to starting end
  s += s_length - t_length;

  if (my_strcmp(s, t) == 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

int my_strcmp(char *s, char *t) {

  while (*s++ == *t++) {
    if (*s == '\0') {
      return 0;
    }
  }
  return *s - *t;
}

```

### Exercise 5-5.

Write versions of the library functions `strncpy`, `strncat`, and `strncmp`, which
operate on at most the first n characters of their argument strings. For example,
`strncpy(s,t,n)` copies at most n characters of `t` to `s`.

1. `strncpy`

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <string.h>
   #include <unistd.h>

   #define MAXLENGTH 1000

   void my_strncpy(char *s, char *t, const size_t n);

   int main(void) {

     char foo[MAXLENGTH] = "Hello, World!\n";
     char *bar = "Hello, C Book\n";

     my_strncpy(foo, bar, 5);
     printf("%s", foo);

     // my_strncpy(foo, bar, 3000);
     // printf("%s", foo);
     return 0;
   }

   void my_strncpy(char *s, char *t, const size_t n) {

     int length_t = strlen(t);
     int length_s = strlen(s);

     if (n > length_t) {
       printf("Error");
       return;
     }

     while (*s != '\0') {
       s++;
     }

     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       *s++ = *t++;
     }
   }

   ```

2. `strncat`

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <string.h>

   #define EXIT_SUCCESS 0
   #define MAXLENGTH 1000

   void my_strncat(char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

   int main(void) {

     char foo[MAXLENGTH] = "Hello, Strncat";
     char bar[] = ", I must say hay\n";

     my_strncat(foo, bar, strlen(bar));

     printf("%s", foo);

     return EXIT_SUCCESS;
   }

   void my_strncat(char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n) {

     int length_s1 = strlen(s1);
     int length_s2 = strlen(s2);

     if (MAXLENGTH < length_s1 + length_s2) {
       return;
     }

     while (*s1 != '\0')
       s1++;

     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
       *s1++ = *s2++;
     }

     *++s1 = '\0';
   }

   ```

3. `strncmp`

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <string.h>

   #define EXIT_SUCCESS 0

   int my_strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

   int main(void) {

     char foo[] = "abca;lkdsfja;lsdkfj";
     char bar[] = "abcalkdsfhj";

     int cmp = my_strncmp(foo, bar, strlen(bar) + 2);

     printf("This should be 0: %d\n", cmp);

     return EXIT_SUCCESS;
   }

   int my_strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n) {

     int length_s1 = strlen(s1);
     int length_s2 = strlen(s2);

     if (n > length_s2) {
       return -1;
     }

     for (int i = 0; i < n && *s1 == *s2; i++, s1++, s2++)
       ;

     if (*s2 == '\0') {
       return 0;
     }

     return *s1 - *s2;
   }

   ```

### Exercise 5-6.

Rewrite appropriate programs from earlier chapters and exercises with pointers
instead of array indexing. Good possibilities include `getline` (Chapters 1 and 4), `atoi`, `itoa`, and their variants (Chapters 2, 3, and 4), `reverse` (Chapter 3), and `strindex` and `getop`(Chapter 4).

1. `getline`

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   #define EXIT_SUCCESS 0
   #define MAXLENGTH 1000

   int my_getline(char *s, int limit);

   int main(void) {

     char foo[MAXLENGTH];

     int foonumber = my_getline(foo, MAXLENGTH);

     printf("%s", foo);
     return EXIT_SUCCESS;
   }

   /*
     my_getline clone of getline function
     return int number of characters
    */
   int my_getline(char *s, int limit) {

     int c, i;

     for (i = 0; i < limit - 1 && (c = getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n'; i++) {
       *(s + i) = c;
     }

     if (c == '\n') {
       *(s + i) = c;
       i++;
     }
     *(s + i) = '\0';
     s -= i;

     return i;
   }

   ```

2. `atoi`

   ```c
   #include <ctype.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <unistd.h>

   int my_atoi(const char *str);

   int main(void) {
     // int number = my_atoi("hello world++-1337");
     int number = my_atoi("---00300hello");
     printf("%d\n", number);
     return 0;
   }

   int my_atoi(const char *str) {

     int result = 0;
     int sign = 1;

     while (!isdigit(*str)) {
       if (*str == '-' || *str == '+') {
         sign *= (*str == '-') ? -1 : 1;
       }
       str++;
     }

     while (isdigit(*str)) {
       result = result * 10 + (*str++ - '0');
     }

     return sign * result;
   }

   ```

3. `itoa` and `reverse`

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <string.h>

   #define MAXLENGTH 10000

   void my_itoa(char *str, int number);
   void reverse(char *str);

   int main(void) {

     char number[MAXLENGTH];
     my_itoa(number, 1337);
     reverse(number);
     printf("The value should be 1337 = %s\n", number);

     my_itoa(number, -1337);
     // printf("this should be 7331- = %s\n", number);
     reverse(number);
     printf("The value should be -1337 = %s\n", number);
     return 0;
   }

   void my_itoa(char *str, int number) {

     int result = 0;

     int sign = (number < 0) ? -1 : 1;
     if (sign == -1)
       number *= -1;

     do {
       *str++ = (number % 10) + '0';
     } while (((int)(number /= 10)) > 0);

     if (sign == -1)
       *str++ = '-';
     *str = '\0';
   }

   void reverse(char *str) {

     int str_length = strlen(str);

     char placeholder[str_length + 1];
     strcpy(placeholder, str);

     for (int i = str_length - 1, j = 0; i >= 0 && placeholder[j] != '\0';
          i--, j++) {
       *(str + i) = placeholder[j];
     }
     *(str + str_length + 1) = '\0';
   }

   ```

4. `strindex`

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int my_strindex(char *str1, const char *str2);

   int main(void) {

     int index = my_strindex("do Hello, World\n", "Hello, ");
     printf("should be 4: %d\n", index);

     int anotherIndex = my_strindex("h", "h");

## 5.6 Pointer Arrays; Pointers to Pointers

This part i found it pretty hard and i did like, basically it's a program that takes buffer inputs and sort them in an alphabetical order.

## 5.7 Multi-dimensional Arrays

C provides rectangular multi-dimensional arrays, although in practice they are much less used than arrays of pointers. In this section, we will show some of their properties.

let's consider the problem of data conversion from day of months to day o the year and vise versa so from example _March 1st_ is the 60th day of a non leap year otherwise it's the 61 day of a leap year.

So let's create tow function

1. `day_of_year`convert the month and day to a day of the year.
2. `month_day` convert the day of the year to the month and day

`month_day` would be like this

```c
month_day(1988, 60, &m, &d)
// sets m to 2 and d to 29 (February 29th).
```

`day_of_year` :

```c
/* representation of number of days each month has for leap and non leap year */
static char daytab[2][13] = {{0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31},
                             {0, 31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}};

/* day of year: set day of the year from month and day */
int day_of_year(int year, int month, int day);

int main(void) { return 0; }

/* day of year: set day of the year from month and day */
int day_of_year(int year, int month, int day) {

  int i, leap;
  leap = year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0;

  for (i = 1; i < month; i++) {
    day += daytab[leap][i];
  }
  return day;
}
```

`month_year` :

```c
/* representation of number of days each month has for leap and non leap year */
static char daytab[2][13] = {{0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31},
                             {0, 31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}};

/* month day: set month, day, from day of the year */
void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday);

int main(void) { return 0; }

/* month day: set month, day, from day of the year */
void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday) {

  int i, leap;

  leap = year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 ||
         year % 400 == 0; /* leap is either 0 or 1 */

  for (i = 1; yearday > daytab[leap][i];
       i++) { /* this checks if there is more days than a month */
    yearday -= daytab[leap][i];
  }
  *pmonth = i;
  *pday = yearday;
}

```

There is a zero months numbers, we used 1 as the first index that is way.

`daytab` is the first two-dimensional array we have dealt with. In `C`, a two-dimensional array is really a one-dimensional array, each of whose elements is an array. Hence subscripts,

This definition somehow confused me but it's like this

```c
        j   j + 1
i     |    |     |    |     |    |     |
i + 1 |    |     |    |     |    |     |
```

```c
        0     1     2    3     4     5
0     |    |     |    |     |     |     |
1     |    |     |    |     |     |     |
```

are written as

```c
daytab[i][j] /* [row][col] */

rather than

daytab[i,j] /* WRONG */
```

If a two-dimensional array is to be passed to a function, the parameter declaration in the function must include the number of columns; the number of rows is irrelevant, since what is passed is, as before, a pointer to an array of rows, where each row is an array of 13 ints. In this particular case, it is a pointer to objects that are arrays of 13 ints. Thus if the array `daytab` is to be passed to a function `f`, the declaration of `f` would be:

```c
f(int daytab[2][13]) { ... }
/* It could also be */

f(int daytab[][13]) { ... }
/*
	since the number of rows is irrelevant, or it could be
*/

f(int (*daytab)[13]) { ... }
/*
which says that the parameter is a pointer to an array of 13 integers. The parentheses are necessary since brackets [] have higher precedence than *. Without parentheses, the declaration
*/
```

```c
int *daytab[13]
```

is an array of 13 pointers to integers. More generally, only the first dimension `(subscript)` of an array is free; all the others have to be specified.

### Exercise 5-8.

There is no error checking in `day_of_year` or `month_day`. Remedy this defect.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* representation of number of days each month has for leap and non leap year */
static char daytab[2][13] = {{0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31},
                             {0, 31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}};

/* day of year: set day of the year from month and day */
int day_of_year(int year, int month, int day);

int main(void) {
  int y = 1984, m = 6, d = 30, yd = 366;
  int *pm, *pd;

  printf("Day: %d\n", day_of_year(y, m, d));
  return 0;
}

/* day of year: set day of the year from month and day */
int day_of_year(int year, int month, int day) {

  int i, leap;
  leap = year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0;
  if (month < 1 && month > 12) {
    printf("error: invalid month\n");
    return -1;
  }
  if (day < 0 || day > daytab[leap][month]) {
    printf("error: invalid day\n");
    return -1;
  }

  for (i = 1; i < month; i++) {
    day += daytab[leap][i];
  }
  return day;
}

```

```c
/* representation of number of days each month has for leap and non leap year */
#include <stdio.h>
static char daytab[2][13] = {{0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31},
                             {0, 31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}};

/* month day: set month, day, from day of the year */
void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday);

int main(void) {
  int y = 1984, m = 6, d = 30, yd = 366;
  int *pm, *pd;

  month_day(y, yd, pm, pd);
  printf("Month: %d, Day: %d\n", *pm, *pd);
  return 0;
}

/* month day: set month, day, from day of the year */
void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday) {

  int i, leap;

  leap = year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 ||
         year % 400 == 0; /* leap is either 0 or 1 */

  if (leap) {
    if (yearday > 365) {
      printf("error: not a valid day\n");
      return;
    }
  } else {
    if (yearday > 366) {
      printf("error: not a valid day\n");
      return;
    }
  }

  for (i = 1; yearday > daytab[leap][i];
       i++) { /* this checks if there is more days than a month */
    yearday -= daytab[leap][i];
  }
  *pmonth = i;
  *pday = yearday;
}

```

## 5.8 Initialization of Pointer Arrays

we want to make a function that return the month name based from the given month number

```c
/*
	input  : 3
	output: Mars
*/
/*
	input  : -20
	output: Illegal month
*/
```

So instead of creating a globale variable to main instead let's create a globale array of strings variable for the current function `month_name()` and return the current index of it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* month_name: return name of n-th month */
char *month_name(int n);

int main(void) {
  char *myMonth = month_name(10);
  printf("My Month: %s\n", myMonth);
  return 0;
}

char *month_name(int n) {
  static char *name[] = {
      "Illegal month",
      "January",
      "Faburary",
      "Mars",
      "April",
      "May",
      "Jun",
      "July",
      "August",
      "Octobre",
      "Novomber",
      "December",
  };

  return (n < 1 || n > 12) ? name[0] : name[n];
}

```

## 5.9 Pointers vs. Multi-dimensional Arrays

Newcomers to C are sometimes confused about the difference between a two-dimensional
array and an array of pointers, such as name in the example above. Given the definitions`int a[10][20]; int *b[10];`
then `a[3][4]` and `b[3][4]` are both syntactically legal references to a single int. But a is a true two-dimensional array: 200 int-sized locations have been set aside, and the conventional

### Exercise 5-9.

Rewrite the routines `day_of_year` and `month_day` with pointers instead of
indexing.

1. `day_of_year`

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   /* representation of number of days each month has for leap and non leap year */
   int leap[] = {0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
   int unleap[] = {0, 31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};

   static int *daytab[2] = {leap, unleap};

   /* day of year: set day of the year from month and day */
   int day_of_year(int year, int month, int day);

   int main(void) {
     int y = 1984, m = 6, d = 30, yd = 366;
     int *pm, *pd;

     printf("Day: %d\n", day_of_year(y, m, d));
     return 0;
   }

   /* day of year: set day of the year from month and day */
   int day_of_year(int year, int month, int day) {

     int i, leap;
     leap = year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0;
     if (month < 1 && month > 12) {
       printf("error: invalid month\n");
       return -1;
     }
     if (day < 0 || day > *(*(daytab + leap) + month)) {
       printf("error: invalid day\n");
       return -1;
     }

     for (i = 1; i < month; i++) {
       day += *(*(daytab + leap) + i);
     }
     return day;
   }
   ```

2. `month_day`

   ```c
   /* representation of number of days each month has for leap and non leap year */
   #include <stdio.h>
   int leap[] = {0, 31, 29, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
   int unleap[] = {0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
   static int *daytab[2] = {leap, unleap};

   /* month day: set month, day, from day of the year */
   void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday);

   int main(void) {
     int y = 1984, m = 6, d = 30, yd = 366;
     int *pm, *pd;

     month_day(y, yd, pm, pd);
     printf("Month: %d, Day: %d\n", *pm, *pd);
     return 0;
   }

   /* month day: set month, day, from day of the year */
   void month_day(int year, int yearday, int *pmonth, int *pday) {

     int i, leap;

     leap = year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 ||
            year % 400 == 0; /* leap is either 0 or 1 */

     if (leap) {
       if (yearday > 366) {
         printf("error: not a valid day\n");
         return;
       }
     } else {
       if (yearday > 365) {
         printf("error: not a valid day\n");
         return;
       }
     }

     /* this checks if there is more days than a month */
     for (i = 1; yearday > (*(*daytab + leap) + i); i++) {
       yearday -= (*(*daytab + leap) + i);
     }
     *pmonth = i;
     *pday = yearday;
   }
   ```

## 5.10 Command-line Arguments

In environments that support C, there is a way to pass command-line arguments or parameters to a program when it begins executing.

When main is called it's called with 2 parameters `argc` : argument counter, has number of parameters given to the program, `argv` : argument vector which is a pointer to an array of characters strings.

We customarily use multiple levels of pointers to manipulate these character strings.

The simplest illustration is the program `echo`, which echoes its command-line arguments on a single line, separated by blanks. That is, the command

```c
/*
	echo hello, world
	prints
	hello, world
*/
```

By convention, `argv[0]` is the name by which the program was invoked, so `argc` is at least `1` If `argc` is `1`, there are no command-line arguments after the program name.

In the example above, `argc` is `3`, and `argv[0],` `argv[1],` and `argv[2]` are `"echo",` `"hello,"`, and `"world"`
respectively.

The first optional argument is `argv[1]` and the last is `argv[argc];` additionally, the standard requires that `argv[argc]` be a null pointer.

![argv.png](./Media/argv.png)

So it's implementations should be like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int i;

  for (i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
    printf("%s%s", argv[i], (i < argc - 1) ? " " : "");
  }
  printf("\n");

  return 0;
}
/*
	-> gcc echo.c -o myecho # myecho to not conflict with the built in echo
	-> ./myecho Hello, World
		-> Hello, World
*/
```

Since `argv` is a pointer to an array we can manipulate the pointer instead of the index to the array.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* echo command-line argument : 2nd version */
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int i;

  while (--argc > 0) {
    printf("%s%s", *(++argv), (argc > 1) ? " " : "");
  }
  printf("\n");

  return 0;
}
/*
	-> gcc echo.c -o myecho # myecho to not conflict with the built in echo
	-> ./myecho Hello, World
		-> Hello, World
*/

```

Example 2 `find` somewhat like `grep UNIX program`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAXLINE 1000

int my_getline(char *s, int limit);

/*
 The standard lbrary function strstr(s, t) return a pointer to the first
 accurence of the string t in the string s or NULL
*/
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char line[MAXLINE];
  int found = 0;

  if (argc != 2) {
    printf("Usage: find patter\n");
  } else {
    while (my_getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0) {
      if (strstr(line, *(argv + 1)) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", line);
        found++;
      }
    }
  }
  return found;
}

/*
  my_getline clone of getline function
  return int number of characters
 */
int my_getline(char *s, int limit) {

  int c, i;

  for (i = 0; i < limit - 1 && (c = getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n'; i++) {
    *(s + i) = c;
  }

  if (c == '\n') {
    *(s + i) = c;
    i++;
  }
  *(s + i) = '\0';
  s -= i;

  return i;
}

```

### Exercise 5-10.

Write the program `expr`, which evaluates a reverse Polish expression from the command line, where each operator or operand is a separate argument. For example,

```c
expr 2 3 4 + *
evaluates 2 * (3+4).
```

```c
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/* define */
#define EXIT_SUCCESS 0
#define MAXLENGTH 10000

/* functions declarations */
void push(double c);
int pop(void);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  double result = 0;
  int second_operation;
  char c;

  if (argc < 4) {
    printf("Not Enough Arguments\n");
    return 1;
  }
  while (--argc > 0) {
    c = *(*(++argv));
    printf("%c\n", c);

    if (isdigit(c)) {
      push(c - '0');
    } else {
      switch (c) {
      case '+':
        push(pop() + pop());
        break;
      case '*':
        push(pop() * pop());
        break;
      case '-':
        second_operation = pop();
        push(pop() - second_operation);
        break;
      case '/':
        second_operation = pop();
        if (second_operation == 0) {
          printf("Error: No Zero Devition\n");
          break;
        }
        push((int)pop() / (int)second_operation);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  result = pop();
  printf("result is : %f\n", result);
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

int stack_index = -1;
double expretion[MAXLENGTH];

void push(double c) {
  // printf("push: %d\n", c);
  if (stack_index == MAXLENGTH) {
    printf("Error Stack Overflow\n");
    return;
  }
  *(expretion + (++stack_index)) = c;
}

int pop(void) {
  if (stack_index == -1) {
    printf("Error Nothing To Pop\n");
    return 0;
  }
  int temp = *(expretion + (stack_index--));
  // printf("pop: %d\n", temp);
  return temp;
}

```

```bash
gcc expr -o my_expr
./my_expr 6 2 3 + - 4 2 / *
	-> result is : 2

```

### Exercise 5-11 and 5-12.

I'm Sorry :(

### Exercise 5-13.

Write the program `tail`, which prints the last `n` lines of its input. By default, `n`
is set to `10`, let us say, but it can be changed by an optional argument so that.

prints the last `n` lines. The program should behave rationally no matter how unreasonable the input or the value of `n`. Write the program so it makes the best use of available storage; lines should be stored as in the sorting program of Section 5.6, not in a two-dimensional array of fixed size.

```c
/*
  This is a todo
*/
/*
  In this Exercise we need to make a programme that prints the last n lines
  given by the user Example: ./tail -2

  Since The program ask for input lines i am going to use getline function
  -2 is number of lines
    -> hello, sir
    -> hello, world
    -> hello, man

  output:
  -> hello, world
  -> hello, man

getting closer to 1337 pool so no need to complete the exercises of this topic i need to learn `structse`

## 5.11 Pointers to Functions

In `C` a function is not a variable but rather a place of instructions in the memory, so we can make a pointer to have the address of the function for example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void display(int number1, int number2, int (*function)(int, int));
int multiply_numbers(int number1, int number2);
int sum(int, int);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  display(20, 10, multiply_numbers);

  display(20, 10, sum);
  return 0;
}

void display(int number1, int number2, int (*function)(int, int)) {
  printf("This is a value: %d\n", function(number1, number2));
}
int multiply_numbers(int number1, int number2) { return number1 * number2; }
int sum(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

```

This is a simple program to understand the concept of function to pointers

## 5.12 Complicated Declarations

Declarations in `C` can't be read left to right so that's why we use `()` so for example:

```c
int *f(); /* f: function returning pointer to int */

int (*pf)();/* pf: pointer to function returning int */
```

illustrates the problem: `*` is a prefix operator and it has lower precedence than `()`, so parentheses are necessary to force the proper association.

This is starting to blow my head

![Complicated Declarations](./Media/Complicated_Declaration.png)

# Chapter 6 - Structures

A Structure is a collection of one or more variables, might be of same or different type grouped together in a single name.

For example an employee is described by a set of attributes such as a name, address, social security number, salary, etc. So employee can be a struct.

Another example is in computers a ball has tow axis x and y.

## 6.1 Basics of Structures

So Lets use the ball example and create a `structure` from it we will assume that both `x` and `y` axis are `integers` .

![Point Structure](./Media/point.png)

Both components can be placed in a struct like this:

```c
struct point {
	int x;
	int y;
}
```

The keyword `struct` introduces a structure declaration, which is a list of declarations
enclosed in braces.

An optional name called a _structure tag_ may follow the word struct `(as
with point here)`.

The tag names this kind of structure, and can be used subsequently as a
shorthand for the part of the declaration in braces.

The variables named in a structure are called members.

A structure `member` or a `tag` or `non-member` variables can have same name without any conflict

A `struct` declaration defines a type. The right brace that terminates the list of members may
be followed by a list of variables.

just as for any basic type. That is,

```c
struct { ... } x, y, z;

is syntactically like

int x, y, z;
```

A structure declaration that is not followed by a list of variables has no storage, it just describe that shape of the structure.

after we call it it behaves the same

```c
struct point {
	int x;
	int y;
};

int main(void)
{
	struct point pt;
	return 0;
}
```

so `pt` is a variable of type `struct point`.

using _structure-name.member_
The structure member operator `.` connects the `structure` name and `member` name to get member's value

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct point {
  int x;
  int y;
} x, y, z;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

  x.x = 10;
  x.y = 20;

  printf("x ---> %d\ny ---> %d\n", x.x, x.y);
  return 0;
}
```

This would produce:

```c
x ---> 10
y ---> 20
```

Structure can also be nested, for example we can represent a rectangle using tow points

![rectangle structure](./Media/rectangle.png)

```c
struct rect {
	struct point pt1;
	struct point pt2;
}
```

`rect` structure contains two `point` structures, so

```c
struct rect screen;
screen.pt1.x
```

refers to the x coordinate of pt1 in the screen.

## 6.2 Structures and Functions

Let us investigate structures by writing some functions to manipulate points and rectangles.
There are at least three possible approaches:

Each has its good points and bad points.

```c
#ifndef POINT_H
#define POINT_H

#define XMAX 220
#define YMAX 200

#define min(a, b) ((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b))
#define max(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

struct point makepoint(int x, int y);
struct point addpoints(struct point p1, struct point p2);
int ptinrect(struct point p, struct rec r);
struct rec canonrect(struct rec r);

struct point {
  int x;
  int y;
};

struct rec {
  struct point p1;
  struct point p2;
};

#endif
```

### Pass components separately & Pass an entire structure.

```c
#include "header.h"

int main(void) {

  struct rec screen;
  struct point middle;

  screen.p1 = makepoint(0, 0);
  screen.p2 = makepoint(XMAX, YMAX);

  int middle_x = (screen.p1.x + screen.p2.x) / 2;
  int middle_y = (screen.p1.y + screen.p2.y) / 2;

  middle = makepoint(middle_x, middle_y);

  return 0;
}

/* makepoint: make a point from x and y components */
struct point makepoint(int x, int y) {

  struct point temp;

  temp.x = x;
  temp.y = y;
  return temp;
}

/* addpoints: add two points */
struct point addpoints(struct point p1, struct point p2) {

  p1.x += p2.x;
  p1.y += p2.y;
  return p1;
}

/* ptinrect: return 1 if p in r, 0 if not */
int ptinrect(struct point p, struct rec r) {
  return p.x >= r.p1.x && p.x < r.p2.x && p.y >= r.p1.y && p.y < r.p2.y;
}

/* canonrect: canonicalize coordinates of rectangle */
struct rec canonrect(struct rec r) {
  struct rec temp;
  temp.p1.x = min(r.p1.x, r.p2.x);
  temp.p1.y = min(r.p1.y, r.p2.y);
  temp.p2.x = max(r.p1.x, r.p2.x);
  temp.p2.y = max(r.p1.y, r.p2.y);
  return temp;
}
```

### Pass a pointer to it.

If a large `structure` is to be passed to a function, it is generally more efficient to pass a _pointer_ than to copy the whole structure. Structure pointers are just like pointers to ordinary variables. The declaration

```c
struct point *pp;
```

so `pp` is a pointer to a structure of type `struct point`.

if `pp` points to a `point struct` then `(*pp)` is the structure it's self, and `(*pp).x` is it's member same thing for y member.

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

  struct point origin, *pp;

  origin = makepoint(10, 20);

  pp = &origin;

  printf("x ---> %d\ny ---> %d\n", (*pp).x, (*pp).y);

  return 0;
}
```

in particular pointers to structures are so popular that an alternative notation is provided for them.

instead of dereferencing the pointer then get member of the struct you can make this `p->member-of-structure`

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

  struct point origin, *pp;

  origin = makepoint(10, 20);

  pp = &origin;

  printf("x ---> %d\ny ---> %d\n", pp->x, pp->y);

  return 0;
}
```

For example

```c
struct rec r, *rp = &r;
```

Then

```c
/*
	r.p1.x
	same as
	rp->p1.x

	(r.p1).x
	same as
	(rp->p1).x
*/
```

So we have this struct:

```c
struct {
	int len;
	char *str;
} *p;
```

```c
++p->len
```

increments `len`, not `p`, because the implied parenthesization is `++(p->len)`. Parentheses can be used to alter binding: `(++p)->len` increments `p` before accessing `len`, and `(p++)->len` increments `p` afterward. (This last set of parentheses is unnecessary.)

## 6.3 Arrays of Structures

```c
#include "header.h"
#include <stdio.h>

struct key keytab[] = {{"auto", 0},     {"break", 0},    {"case", 0},
                       {"char", 0},     {"const", 0},    {"continue", 0},
                       {"default", 0},  {"unsigned", 0}, {"void", 0},
                       {"volatile", 0}, {"while", 0}};

#define NKEYS (sizeof(keytab) / sizeof(struct key))

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int n;
  char word[MAXWORD];

  while (ft_getword(word, MAXWORD) != EOF)
  {
    if (isprint(word[0]))
    {
      printf("word : %s\n", word);
      if ((n = binsearch(word, keytab, NKEYS)) >= 0)
        keytab[n].count++;
    }
  }

  /* Print word and it's counter */
  for (n = 0; n < NKEYS; n++)
  {
    if (keytab[n].count > 0)
      printf("\n%4d %s\n", keytab[n].count, keytab[n].word);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

```c
#include "../header.h"

int binsearch(char *word, struct key *tab, int n)
{
  int cond = 0;
  int low, mid, high;

  low = 0;
  high = n - 1;
  while (low <= high)
  {
    mid = (int)(low + high) / 2;
    cond = strcmp(word, tab[mid].word);
    if (cond < 0)
      high = mid - 1;
    else if (cond > 0)
      low = mid + 1;
    else
      return mid;
  }
  return -1;
}
```

```c
#include "../header.h"

static int pb_char = '\0';
static int pb_flag = 0;

int getch(void) { return (pb_flag == 1) ? pb_flag = 0, pb_char : getchar(); }

void ungetch(int c)
{
  pb_char = c;
  pb_flag = 1;
}

void ungets(const char s[])
{
  int i, c;
  i = 0;
  while ((c = s[i++]) != '\0')
  {
    ungetch(s[i++]);
  }
}

/* ft_getword: get next word or character from input */
int ft_getword(char *word, int lim)
{

  int c;
  char *w = word;

  while (isspace(c = getch()))
    ;
  if (c == EOF)
  {
    *w = EOF;
    return c;
  }
  if (!isprint(c))
  {
    *w = '\0';
    return c;
  }
  do
  {
    if (!isprint(c))
      break;
    lim--;
    *w++ = c;
    c = getch();
  } while (lim > 0);
  *w = '\0';
  return word[0];
}

```

### Exercise 6-1.

Our version of getword does not properly handle underscores, string constants,
comments, or preprocessor control lines. Write a better version.

By changing the `isalpha` function in `getword` to `isprint`, That would do it.

## 6.4 Pointers to Structures

To understand pointer to structure let's create the same program but using pointer to structures

- `getword` stills the same
- `binsearch.c`

  ```c
  #include "../header.h"

  struct key *binsearch(char *word, struct key *tab, int n)
  {
    int cond = 0;
    struct key *low = &tab[0];
    struct key *mid;
    struct key *high = &tab[n - 1];

    while (low <= high)
    {
      mid = (low + (high - low) / 2);
      cond = strcmp(word, mid->word);
      if (cond < 0)
        high = mid - 1;
      else if (cond > 0)
        low = mid + 1;
      else
        return mid;
    }
    return NULL;
  }
  ```

- `count_words.c`

  ```c
  #include "header.h"
  #include <stdio.h>

  struct key keytab[] = {{"auto", 0},     {"break", 0},    {"case", 0},
                         {"char", 0},     {"const", 0},    {"continue", 0},
                         {"default", 0},  {"unsigned", 0}, {"void", 0},
                         {"volatile", 0}, {"while", 0},    {NULL, 0}};

  #define NKEYS (sizeof(keytab) / sizeof(struct key))

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
    struct key *p;
    char word[MAXWORD];

    while (ft_getword(word, MAXWORD) != EOF)
    {
      if (isprint(word[0]))
      {
        printf("word : %s\n", word);
        if ((p = binsearch(word, keytab, NKEYS)) != NULL)
          p->count++;
      }
    }

    /* Print word and it's counter */
    for (p = keytab; p->word != NULL; p++)
    {
      if (p->count > 0)
        printf("\n%4d %s\n", p->count, p->word);
    }
    return 0;
  }

  ```

## 6.5 Self-referential Structures

> With arbitrary data, we need an arbitrary data structure.

Suppose we want to handle a big amount of data or an unknown amount of words how can we achieve that?

I a Simple words we will use a data structure, `binary tree`.

The tree contains one node per distinct word, each node contains:

- A pointer to the word
- A count of The number of occurrence
- A pointer to the left child node.
- A pointer to the right child node.

The nodes are maintained so that at any node the left subtree contains only words that are
lexicographically less than the word at the node, and the right subtree contains only words
that are greater.

![btree](./Media/btree.png)

To find out whether a new word is already in the tree, start at the root and compare the new word to the word stored at that node. If they match, the question is answered affirmatively. If the new record is less than the tree word, continue searching at the left child, otherwise at the right child. If there is no child in the required direction, the new word is not in the tree, and in fact the empty slot is the proper place to add the new word. This process is recursive, since the search from any node uses a search from one of its children. Accordingly, recursive routines for insertion and printing will be most natural.

**I made this program check it in the files :)**

### Exercise 6-2.

Write a program that reads a C program and prints in alphabetical order each
group of variable names that are identical in the first 6 characters, but different somewhere
thereafter. Don't count words within strings and comments. Make 6 a parameter that can be
set from the command line.

[Check Chapter 6 Solution](./Chapter_06/6-5/6-2/)

## 6.6 Table Lookup

In this Section we made a data structure called hashmap, it will be represented like this:

![hashmap](./Media/hashmap.png)

### Exercise 6-5 6-6.

[Check Chapter 6 Solution](./Chapter_06/6-6/)

## 6.7 Typedef

In C we have `typedef` for creating a new data type name, hhh i wished knew this in 42 pool

```c
typedef int Length;
```

now `Length` is a synonym for `int`

```c
Length len, maxlen;
Length *lengths[];
```

So on like:

```c
typedef char *String;
```

The best use of this is with structs, instead of using `struct` key word
and `structe name`, we only need to use it's name using `typedef`

```c
typedef struct tnode* Treeptr; /* Treeptr is a pointer to struct tnode */

typedef struct tnode {
   char *word;
    int count;
    struct tnode *left;
    struct tnode *right;
} Treenode; /* Treenode is a type definition of struct tnode */
```

This creates two new keywords `Treenode` a structure and `Treeptr` a pointer to the structure
so if we want to implement a function that allocates memory for `struct tnode` which is `Treenode`
would be like this:

```c
Treeptr talloc(void)
{
    return (Treeptr) malloc(sizeof(Treenode));
}
```

## 6.8 Unions

```c
union u_tag {
    int ival;
    float fval;
    char *sval;
} u;
```

The variable `u` will be large enough to hold the larges of the three
types.

For example the `u` can hold a value of `int`, `float` or `char *`

Syntactically members of a union are accessed as

_union-name.member_

or

_union-pointer->member_

if the variable `utype` is used to keep track of the current type stored in `u`

then we might see code like this.

```c
if (utype == INT)
    printf("%d\n", u.ival);
if (utype == FLOAT)
    printf("%d\n", u.fval);
if (utype == STRING)
    printf("%d\n", u.sval);
else
    printf("bad type $d in utype\n", utype);
```

Unions may occur within structures and arrays, and vice versa. The notation for accessing a
member of a union in a structure (or vice versa) is identical to that for nested structures.

For example in the structure array defined by

```c
struct {
    char *name;
    int flags;
    int utype;
    union {
        int ival;
        float fval;
        char *sval;
    } u;
} symtab[NSYM];
```

The member `ival` is referred to as

```c
symtab[i].u.ival;
```

And the first character of the string `sval` by either of

```c
*symtab[i].u.savl;

symtab[i].u.savl[0];
```

In effect, a union is a structure in which all members have offset zero from the base, the
structure is big enough to hold the ``widest'' member, and the alignment is appropriate for all
of the types in the union. The same operations are permitted on unions as on structures:
assignment to or copying as a unit, taking the address, and accessing a member.

## 6.9 Bit-fields

No idea what's that :|

# Chapter 7 - Input and Output

Input and output are not part of the `C` language itself.

In this Chapter we are going to understand the **Standard library**.

A set of function that provide input and output, such as:

- String handling
- Storage management
- mathematical routines
- and a variety of other services for `C` programs.

We will concentrate on input and output.

The **ANSI** standard defines these library functions presisely. so that they can exist in
compatibale form on any stystem where `C` exist.

## 7.1 Standard Input and Output

I hope that we would have a look of how it's implemented.

The simplest input mechanism is to read on character at a time form the _standard input_
normally the keyboard, using `getchar`:

```c
int getchar(void);
```

`getchar` returns the next input character each time it is called or `EOF`
when it encounter end of file.

Symbolic constant `EOF` is defined in `<stdio.h>`, it's value is `-1`

In many envirmoments, a file may be substituted for the keyboard by using `<` convention
for input redirection: if a program `main` uses `getchar`, the the command line

```bash
main < input-file.txt
```

causes `main` to read characters from `input-file.txt` instead.

The string `< input-file.txt` is not included in `argv`.

Input switching is also invisible if the input comes from another program via a pipe mechanism

```bash
otherprog | main
```

runs the two programs, and pipes the standard output of `otherprog` into the standard input of `main`

The function

```c
int putchar(int);
```

is used for output `putchar(c)` puts the character c on the `standard output`
which is by default the screen.

Output produced by `printf` also finds it's way to the standard output.

Each source file that refers to an `input/output` library must contain the line

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

When the name is bracketed by `<>` a search is made for the header in a standard set of places
for example is `UNIX`systems, typically in the directory `usr/include`

### Exercise 7-1.

Write a program that converts upper case to lower or lower case to upper,
depending on the name it is invoked with, as found in `argv[0]`.

```c
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *str = argv[0];
  while (*str)
  {
    if (islower(*str))
      putchar(toupper(*str));
    else if (isupper(*str))
      putchar(tolower(*str));
    else
      putchar(*str);
    str++;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## 7.2 Formatted Output - printf

Every one have written `C`, probably used `printf`.

To know it's full story consider reading Appendix B.

```c
int printf(char *format, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

`printf` converts `format` and prints it's arguments on the standard output
under control of `format`.

`printf` returns the number of character printed.

```c
int hello = printf("%d, %d\n", 10, 20); /* prints "10, 20" */
printf("%d", hello);                    /* prints "7" -> "10, 20\n" */
```

The format string contains two types of objects:

- ordinary: character which are copied to the output stream
- conversion specification each of which causes conversion and printing the next successive argument

Each conversion specification begin with `%` and ends with a conversion character .

Between the `%` and the conversion character they may be in order

- A minus sign. which specifies left adjustment of the converted argument
- A number that specifies the minimum field with. The converted argument will be
  printed in a field at least this wide.

  ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       printf("|%-20s| %s|\n", "Name", "Age");
       printf("|%-20s| %d|\n", "John Doe", 25);
       return 0;
   }
  ```

- A period, which separates the field with from the precision.
- A number that specifies the maximum number of character to be printed from a string.
  or the number of digits after the decimal point of a floating-point
- An `h` if the integer is to be printed as a `short` or `1` letter if as `long`

If the character after `%` is not a conversion specification, the begavior is undefined

| Character | Argument type; Printed As                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

`-` is a space

`printf` uses it's first argument to decide how many arguments follow and what their type is.

You will get wrong output if it miss count number of arguments from the buffer
also, you need to know the difference between these two calls

```c
printf(s); /* FAILS if s contains % */
printf("%s", s); /* SAFE to use */
```

`sprintf` is one of `printf`'s family

`sprintf` does that same work as `printf` but instead of printing it, it store it in a buffer

```c
int sprintf(char *string, char *format, arg1, arg2);
```

## 7.3 Variable-length Argument Lists

In this section we're going to make a simplt printf.

The proper declaration for `printf` is

```c
int printf(char *fmt, ...);
```

The declaration `...` means that the number and types of these arguments maay vary.
also the declaration can only appert at the end of an argument list

Our `minprintf` is declared as

```c
void minprintf(char *fmt, ...);
```

we will not return number of characters like `printf`

`<stdarg.h>` provide a set of macro definitions that define how to step through an argument list

`va_list` is used to declare a variable that will refer to each argument in turn
in `minprintf` this variable is called `ap`: **argument pointer**.

The macro `va_start` initialize `ap` to point to the first unnamed argument.
it must be called once before `ap` is used, it must be at least on named argument

Each call of `va_arg` returns one argument and step `ap` to the next argument

`va_arg` uses a type name to determine what type to return an how big a step to take.

`va_end` does whatever cleanup is necessary. it must be called before the program returns.

`minprintf` Example

### Exercise 7-3.

Revise minprintf to handle more of the other facilities of printf.

```c
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

/* minprintf: minimal printf with variable argument list */
void minprintf(const char *fmt, ...)
{
  va_list ap; /* points to each unnamed arg in turn */
  const char *p;
  union u_tag
  {
    int ival;
    int cval;
    float fval;
    double dval;
    char *sval;
    unsigned int uival;
    unsigned int xval;
    unsigned int oval;
    void *pval;
  } type;

  va_start(ap, fmt); /* make ap point to 1st unnamed arg */
  for (p = fmt; *p; p++)
  {
    if (*p != '%')
    {
      putchar(*p);
      continue;
    }
    switch (*++p)
    {
    case 'd':
      type.ival = va_arg(ap, int);
      printf("%d", type.ival);
      break;
    case 'f':
      type.dval = va_arg(ap, double);
      printf("%f", type.dval);
      break;
    case 'x':
      type.xval = va_arg(ap, unsigned int);
      printf("%x", type.xval);
      break;
    case 'X':
      type.xval = va_arg(ap, unsigned int);
      printf("%X", type.xval);
      break;
    case 'u':
      type.uival = va_arg(ap, unsigned int);
      printf("%u", type.uival);
      break;
    case 'o':
      type.oval = va_arg(ap, unsigned int);
      printf("%o", type.oval);
      break;
    case 'c':
      type.cval = va_arg(ap, int);
      putchar(type.cval);
      break;
    case 's':
      type.sval = va_arg(ap, char *);
      for (char *s = type.sval; *s; s++)
        putchar(*s);
      break;
    case 'p':
      type.sval = va_arg(ap, void *);
      printf("%p", type.pval);
      break;
    default:
      putchar(*p);
      break;
    }
    va_end(ap); /* clean up when done */
  }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *ptr = "42";
  printf("hello world | %s --> %p | strlen(ptr) = %d = %f | ptr[0] = \'%c\' = "
         "0x\\%x = 0x\\%x = o\\%o | %u%% \n",
         ptr, &ptr, (int)strlen(ptr), ((int)strlen(ptr) / 1.0), ptr[0], ptr[0],
         ptr[0], ptr[0], 4 - 10);
  minprintf(
      "hello world | %s --> %p | strlen(ptr) = %d = %f | ptr[0] = \'%c\' = "
      "0x\\%x = 0x\\%x = o\\%o | %u%%\n",
      ptr, &ptr, (int)strlen(ptr), ((int)strlen(ptr) / 1.0), ptr[0], ptr[0],
      ptr[0], ptr[0], 4 - 10);
  return 0;
}
```

## 7.4 Formatted Input - Scanf

`scanf` is the input analog of `printf`.

In 42 we need to make tow functions:

- `ft_printf` a clone of `printf`.
- `get_next_line` a clone of `scanf`.

Form scratch just using the syscall `write`

```c
int scanf(char *format, ...);
```

`scanf`:

- reads characters from the standard input, based on the specification in `format`
- stops when it exhausts it's format string, or when some input fails to match the control specification
- returns the number of scuccessfully matched and assigned input items

There is alost a function `sscanf` that reads from a string instead of the _standard input_

```c
int sscanf(char *string, char *format, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

It scans the `string` based on the `format` and stores the result in `arg1` and `arg2`

Basic `Scanf` Conversions Table

| Character | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| d         | decimal integer; `int *`                                                                                                                                                                             |
| i         | integer; `int *`. The integer may be in octal (leading 0) or hexadecimal (leading 0x or 0X).                                                                                                         |
| o         | octal integer (with or without leading zero); `int *`                                                                                                                                                |
| u         | unsigned decimal integer; `unsigned int *`                                                                                                                                                           |
| x         | hexadecimal integer (with or without leading 0x or 0X); `int *`                                                                                                                                      |
| c         | characters; `char *`. The next input characters (default 1) are placed at the indicated spot. The normal skip-over white space is suppressed; to read the next non-white space character, use `%1s`. |
| S         | character string (not quoted); `char *`, pointing to an array of characters long enough for the string and a terminating `\0` that will be added.                                                    |
| e, f, g   | floating-point number with optional sign, optional decimal point, and optional exponent; `float *`                                                                                                   |
| %         | literal %; no assignment is made.                                                                                                                                                                    |

Suppose we want to read input lines that contain dates of the form which are like this

**05 Oct 2024**

The scanf statement would be like this

```c
int day, year;
char monthname[20];

scanf("%d %s %d", &day, monthname, &year);
```

`monthname` is array name which is just a pointer so no need to `&`

also we can read dates of the form `mm/dd/yy` with `scanf`

```c
int day, month, year;
scanf("%d/%d/%d", &mont, &day, &year);
```

`scanf` ignores blanks and tabs in the format string,
also it skips white spaces (blanks, tabs, newline, ...)

`"%d/%d/%d"` == `"%d/ %d/ %d"` == `"%d/ \t%d/ \t%d"`

It is often best to read a line at a time, then pick it a part using `sscanf`

For example

```c
while (getline(line, sizeof(line)) > 0)
{
    if (sscanf(line, "%d %s %d", &day, monthname, &year) == 3)
        printf("valid: %s\n", line); /* 05 Oct 2024 */
    else if (sscanf(line, "%d %d %d", &mont, &day, &year) == 3)
        printf("valid: %s\n", line); /* 10/05/2024 */
    else
        printf("invalid: %s\n", line);
}
```

ARGUMENTS TO `scanf` and `sscanf` MUST BE A POINTER.

**This error is not generally detected at a compile time**

```c
scanf("%d", n);
```

instead of

```c
scanf("%d", &n);
```

## 7.5 File Access

This pointer, called the file pointer, points to a structure that contains information about the
file, such as the location of a buffer, the current character position in the buffer, whether the
file is being read or written, and whether errors or end of file have occurred. Users don't need
to know the details, because the definitions obtained from <stdio.h> include a structure
declaration called FILE. The only declaration needed for a file pointer is exemplified by

```c
FILE *fp
FILE *fopen(char *name, char *mode);
```

`fp` is a pointer to a **FILE** structure.

The first argument of fopen is a character string containing the name of the file. The second
argument is the mode, also a character string, which indicates how one intends to use the file.
Allowable modes include read `("r")`, write `("w")`, and append `("a")`. Some systems
distinguis between text and binary files; for the latter, a "b" must be appended to the mode
string.

The next thing needed is a way to read or write the file once it is open. getc returns the next
character from a file; it needs the file pointer to tell it which file.

```c
int getc(FILE *fp);
int putc(int c, FILE *fp);
```

When a `C` program is started, the operating system environment is responsible for opening
three files and providing pointers for them. These files are the standard input, the standard
output, and the standard error; the corresponding file pointers are called `stdin`, `stdout`, and
`stderr`, and are declared in `<stdio.h>`. Normally `stdin` is connected to the keyboard and `stdout` and `stderr` are connected to the screen

`getchar` and `putchar` are just a macros

```c
#define getchar() getc(stdin)
#define putchar(c) putc(c, stdout)
```

`printf`, `scanf` has other brotters `fprintf` and `fscanf`

```c
int fprintf(FILE *fp, char *format, ...);
int fscanf(FILE *fp, char *format, ...);
```

So let's creat `cat`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* cat: concatenate files, version 1 */
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  FILE *fp;
  void filecopy(FILE *, FILE *);

  if (argc == 1) /* no argc: copy standard input */
    filecopy(stdin, stdout);
  else
  {
    while (--argc > 0)
    {
      if ((fp = fopen(*++argv, "r")) == NULL)
      {
        printf("cat: cant\'t open %s\n", *argv);
        return -1;
      }
      else
      {
        filecopy(fp, stdout);
        fclose(fp);
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

/* filecopy: copy file ifp to file ofp */
void filecopy(FILE *ifp, FILE *ofp)
{
  int c;

  while ((c = getc(ifp)) != EOF)
    putc(c, stdout);
}
```

```c
int fclose(FILE *fp);
```

breaks the connection between the printer and the file, and free the content of the pointer
so other files can use it

`fclose` is called automatically for each open file when a program terminates normally.

You can also close `stdin` and `stdout`

## 7.6 Error Handling - Stderr and Exit

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/* cat: concatenate files, version 1 */
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  FILE *fp;
  void filecopy(FILE *, FILE *);
  char *prog = argv[0]; /* program name for errors */

  if (argc == 1) /* no argc: copy standard input */
    filecopy(stdin, stdout);
  else
  {
    while (--argc > 0)
    {
      if ((fp = fopen(*++argv, "r")) == NULL)
      {
        fprintf(stderr, "cat: cant\'t open %s\n", *argv);
        return -1;
      }
      else
      {
        filecopy(fp, stdout);
        fclose(fp);
      }
    }
    if (ferror(stdout))
    {
      fprintf(stderr, "%s: error writing stdout\n", prog);
      exit(2);
    }
  }
  exit(0);
}

/* filecopy: copy file ifp to file ofp */
void filecopy(FILE *ifp, FILE *ofp)
{
  int c;

  while ((c = getc(ifp)) != EOF)
    putc(c, stdout);
}
```

The program signals errors in two ways. First, the diagnostic output produced by fprintf
goes to `stderr`, so it finds its way to the screen instead of disappearing down a pipeline or
into an output file. We included the program name, from `argv[0]`, in the message, so if this
program is used with others, the source of an error is identified.

`exit` has an advantage that it can be called not just from `main` but from all function and stop current process

The function `ferror` returns non-zero if an error occurred on the stream fp.

```c
int ferror(FILE *fp)
```

Although output errors are rare, they do occur _(for example, if a disk fills up)_, so a production program should check this as well.

The function `feof(FILE *)` is analogous to ferror; it returns non-zero if end of file has occurred on the specified file.

```c
int feof(FILE *fp)
```

We have generally not worried about exit status in our small illustrative programs, but any
serious program should take care to return sensible, useful status values.

## 7.7 Line Input and Output

The standard library provides an input and output function `fputs` and `fgets` that is similar to get line
`fputs` and `fgets` are similar to `puts` and `gets` but the last ones oberates on `stdin` and `stdout`

`fgets` reads the next input line (including the newline) from file fp into the character array line
at most `maxline-1` characters will be read.

The resulting line is terminated with `'\0'`.

Normally fgets returns `line`; on end of file or error it returns NULL.

For output, the function `fputs` writes a string (which need not contain a new line) to a file

Confusingly, `gets` deletes the terminating '\n', and `puts` adds it.

`fputs` and `fgets` prototype

```c
int fputs(char *line, FILE *fp);
char *fgets(char *line, int maxline, FILE *fp);
```

`fputs` and `fgets` definitions

```c
/* fgets: get a most n chars from iop */
char *fgets(char *line, int maxline, FILE *iop)
{
    int c;
    char *cs;

    cs = s;
    while (--n > 0 && (c = getc(iop)) != EOF)
    {
        if ((*cs++ = c) == '\n')
            break;
    }
    *cs = '\0';
    return (c == EOF && cs == s) ? NULL : s;
}
```

```c
/* fputs: put string s on file iop */
int fputs(char *s, FILE *fp)
{
    int c;

    while (c = *s++)
        putc(c, iop);
    return ferror(iop) ? EOF : 0;
}
```

### Exercise 7-6.

Write a program to compare two files, printing the first line where they differ.

Exercise 7-7. Modify the pattern finding program of Chapter 5 to take its input from a set of

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_LINE_LEN 100

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *filename[] = {argv[1], argv[2]};
  FILE *fp1;
  FILE *fp2;
  char s1[MAX_LINE_LEN];
  char s2[MAX_LINE_LEN];

  if (argc != 3)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, "Invalid number of arguments\n");
    exit(-1);
  }
  fp1 = fopen(filename[0], "r");
  fp2 = fopen(filename[1], "r");
  while (fgets(s1, MAX_LINE_LEN, fp1) != NULL &&
         fgets(s2, MAX_LINE_LEN, fp2) != NULL)
  {
    if (strcmp(s1, s2) != 0)
    {
      fprintf(stdout, "%s", s1);
      fprintf(stdout, "==================\n");
      fprintf(stdout, "%s", s2);
    }

## 7.8 Miscellaneous Functions

Most of functions here i know them, hack i even going to code them in `42` coursus

The one interesting ones are these

`strchr(s,c)` return pointer to first c in s, or NULL if not present
`strrchr(s,c)` return pointer to last c in s, or NULL if not present

### 7.8.4 Command Execution

This is the first time i new that i can run a command using the `system` function is `c`, Pog.

### 7.8.5 Storage Management

The functions `malloc` and `calloc` obtains blocks of memory dynamically.

```c
void calloc(size_t n, size_t size);
```

`n` is the number of objects of the specified size.
`size` is size of either a type of a struct.

```c
int *ip;
ip = (int *) calloc(n, sizeof(int));
```

On why we need to type cast before memory allocation function?

So far what i know, since a pointer points to a continuous memory.
when need to treversed it the compiler needs size to treversed with, if you compile with warnings
the compiler would yal at ya.

Also don't be dumb and free memory you already freed.

Here is a code that free a linked list.

```c
for (p = head; p != NULL; p = p->next) /* WRONG */
    free(p);
```

The right way is to save whatever is needed before freeing:

```c
for (p = head; p != NULL; p = q) {
    q = p->next;
    free(p);
}
```

# Chapter 8 - The UNIX System Interface

## 8.1 File Descriptors

In the UNIX operating system, all input and output is done by reading or writing files,
because all peripheral devices, even keyboard and screen, are files in the file system. This
means that a single homogeneous interface handles all communication between a program
and peripheral devices.

In the most general case, before you read and write a file, you must inform the system of your
intent to do so, a process called opening the file. If you are going to write on a file it may also
be necessary to create it or to discard its previous contents. The system checks your right to
do so (Does the file exist? Do you have permission to access it?) and if all is well, returns to
the program a small non-negative integer called a **file descriptor**.

Whenever input or output is to be done on the file, the file descriptor is used instead of the name to identify the file. (A file
descriptor is analogous to the file pointer used by the _standard library_, or to the file handle of
MS-DOS.) All information about an open file is maintained by the system; the user program
refers to the file only by the file descriptor.

Since input and output involving keyboard and screen is so common, special arrangements
exist to make this convenient. When the command interpreter (the ``shell'') runs a program,
three files are open, with file descriptors 0, 1, and 2, called the standard input, the standard
output, and the standard error. If a program reads 0 and writes 1 and 2, it can do input and
output without worrying about opening files.

The user program can redirect input and outputs

```bash
prog < input-file > output-file
```

In this case, the shell changes the default assignments for the file descriptors 0 and 1 to the
named files. Normally file descriptor 2 remains attached to the screen, so error messages can
go there. Similar observations hold for input or output associated with a pipe. In all cases, the
file assignments are changed by the shell, not by the program. The program does not know
where its input comes from nor where its output goes, so long as it uses file 0 for input and 1
and 2 for output.

## 8.2 Low Level I/O - Read and Write

Input and output uses the `read` and `write` system calls, which are accessed from `C` programs
through two functions called `read` and `write`.

To use `read` and `write` call `unistd` library

For both, the first argument is a file descriptor.

The second argument is a character array in your program where the data is to go to or to come from.

The third argument is the number is the number of bytes to be transferred.

```c
int n_read = read(int fd, char *buf, int n);
int n_written = write(int fd, char *buf, int n);
```

Each call returns a count of the number of bytes transferred.

On reading, the number of bytes returned may be less than the number requested.

A return value of zero bytes implies end of file, and -1 indicates an error of some sort.

For writing, the return value is the number of bytes written

Error accures if number of bytes differ form number requested.

Any number of bytes can be read or written in one call, common number is `1`, but it can accept big numbers like: `1200`

Large sizes are batter since fewr system calls will be made.

so let's make a program that copies it's input to it's output

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/* copy input to output */
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char buf[BUFSIZ];
  int n;

  while ((n = read(0, buf, sizeof(char) * BUFSIZ)))
    write(1, buf, n);
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Some `read` would return a number smaller than input length, that would lead to a different behave of write returning `0`

`read` and `write` are the bare bone of all higher level routines like `getchar` `putchar`.

```c
#include "syscalls.h"

/* ft_getchar: unbeffered single character input */
int ft_getchar(void)
{
  char c;
  return (read(0, &c, 1) == 1) ? (unsigned char)c : EOF;
}
```

`c` must be a char, read need a character pointer

## 8.3 Open, Creat, Close, Unlink

So youmust explicitly open files in order to read and write them.

There are two system calls for this, `open` and `creat` sys calls.

`open` is like the `fopen` form `stdio.h`, but instead of returning a file pointer, it returns
a file descriptor, which is just an `int`, `open` return `-1` if any error occurs.

So to use `open` and `creat` you need to include `fcntl.h` library

The `fcntl.h` header file is part of the POSIX standard and provides functions for controlling file descriptors,
including file locking, file mode changes, and file status inquiries.

`open()`: Opens a file, returning a file descriptor.
`creat()`: Creates a new file, returning a file descriptor.

```c
#include <fcntl.h>

int fd;
in open(char *name, int flags, int perms);

fd = open(name, flags, perms);
```

The `name` argument is a string represent filename.

The `flags` is an `int` specifies how the file is to be opened, there are quite a lot:

- `O_RDONLY`: Open for reading only.
- `O_WRONLY`: Open for writing only.
- `O_RDWR`: Open for reading and writing.
- `O_CREAT`: Create file if it doesn’t exist.
- `O_EXCL`: Fail if file already exists.
- `O_TRUNC`: Truncate file to zero length.
- `O_APPEND`: Write to end of file.
- `O_NONBLOCK`: Non-blocking I/O.
- `O_ASYNC`: Send SIGIO to owner when data is ready.
- `O_FSYNC`: Synchronous writes.
- `O_SYNC`: Synchronous writes (same as O_FSYNC).

These constants are defined in `<fcntl.h>` on V UNIX systems, and in `<sys/file.h>` on BSD versionns

To oepn an existing file for reading:

```c
fd = open(name, , O_RDONLY, 0);
```

`perams` for now is just `0` why? sir i don't know.

It is an error to try to open a file that doesn't exist.

The system call `creat` creates new files, or to re-write old ones.

```c
int creat(char *name, int perams);

fd = creat(name, perms)
```

returns a file descriptor `fd` if it was able to creat a file.
`-1` if not.
if file already exist, `creat` override it's content and set it's length to `0`.

If the file doesn't exist, `creat` will creates it with the permissions specified by the `perms`.

This is a program like shell command `cp`

```c
#include "../syscalls.h"
#include <sys/fcntl.h>

#define PERMS 0666 /* RW for owner, group and others */

void error(char *, ...);

/* cp: copy f1 to f2 */
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char buf[BUFSIZ];

  int f1, f2, n;
  if (argc != 3)
    error("Usage: cp from to");
  if ((f1 = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY, 0)) == -1)
    error("cp: can't open %s", argv[1]);
  if ((f2 = creat(argv[2], PERMS)) == -1)
    error("cp: can't creat %s, mode %03c", argv[2], PERMS);
  while ((n = read(f1, buf, BUFSIZ)) > 0)
  {
    if (write(f2, buf, n) != n)
      error("cp: write error on file %s", argv[2]);
  }
  return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

Notice that the function `error` is called with variable argument lists much like `printf`.

The implementation of error illustrates how to use another member of the `printf` family.

The standard library function `vprintf` is like `printf` except that the variable argument list is
replaced by a single argument that has been initialized by calling the `va_start` macro.

Similarly, `vfprintf` and `vsprintf` match `fprintf` and `sprintf`.

```c
void error(char *fmt, ...)
{
  va_list args;

  va_start(args, fmt);
  fprintf(stderr, "error: ");
  vprintf(stderr, args);
  fprintf(stderr, "\n");
  va_end(args);
  exit(1);
}
```

There is a limit (often about 20) on the number of files that a program may open simultaneously.

Accordingly, any program that intends to process many files must be prepared to re-use file descriptors.

The function `close(int fd)` breaks the connection between a file descriptor and an open file,
and frees the file descriptor for use with some other file
it corresponds to fclose in the standard library except that there is no buffer to flush.

Termination of a program via exit or return from the main program closes all open files.

### Exercise 8-1.

Rewrite the program cat from Chapter 7 using read, write, open, and close
instead of their standard library equivalents. Perform experiments to determine the relative
speeds of the two versions.

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void error(char *, ...);
void filecopy_to_stdout(char *);

/* HEY: run ./cat input-1.txt input-2.txt */
/* cat program using read, write, open and close */
/* cat: concatenate files, exercise */
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int n;
  char buf[BUFSIZ];

  if (argc == 1)
  {
    while ((n = read(STDIN_FILENO, buf, BUFSIZ)) > 0)
      if (write(STDOUT_FILENO, buf, n) != n)
        error("cat: write error");
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
  }
  while (--argc > 0)
    filecopy_to_stdout(*++argv);
  exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

void filecopy_to_stdout(char *filename)
{
  char buf[BUFSIZ];

  int fd, n;
  if ((fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY, 0)) == -1)
  {
    error("cat: can't open %s", filename);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
  while ((n = read(fd, buf, BUFSIZ)) > 0)
    if (write(STDOUT_FILENO, buf, n) != n)
      error("cat: write error");
  close(fd);
}

void error(char *fmt, ...)
{
  va_list args;

  va_start(args, fmt);
  fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: ");
  vfprintf(stderr, fmt, args);
  fprintf(stderr, "\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

## 8.4 Random Access - Lseek

Each `read` and `write` takes place at a position in the file right after the previous one.

However a file can be read or written in any order.

The systam call `lsee` provides a way to move around in a file without reading or writing and data.

```c
long lseek(int fd, long offset, in original);
```

`lseek` set's the current position in the file to `offset`, which take relative to the location specified by `origin`.

So beased of `offset` and `origin` you determine weather it's going from right to left or vise versa

```c
lseek(fd, (long)0, 2);
```

or

```c
lseek(fd, 0L, 2);
```

Set's the origin to index `2` of the file, to get back to index `0`.

So `lseek` makes it possible to treat file like arrays, but with a slower access

The following code any number of bytes from any arbitrary place in file,
it returns the number read, or `-1` on error.

```c
#include "syscalls.h"

/* get: read n bytes from position pos*/
int get(int fd, long pos, char *buf, int n)
{
    if (lseek(fd, pos, 0) >= 0)
        return read(fd, buf, n);
    else
        return -1;
}
```

### Exercise 8-2.

Rewrite `fopen` and `_fillb` with fields instead of explicit bit operations.

Compare code size and execution speed.

Bit operations code is a bit simpler, readable and shorter

Execution time is slightlly difference

<!-- [Code Solution]() -->

The system call `stat` takes a filename and returns all of the inforamation in the inode for that file, or `-1` if there is and error,
That is:

```c
char *name;
struct stat stbuf;
int stat(char *, struct stat *);

stat(name, &stbuf);
```

So `stat` fills the structure `stbuf` with the indoe information for the file name.

The structure describing the value returned by `stat`.

`stat` typically is in `<sys/stat.h>` and looks like this:

```c
struct stat /* inode information returned by stat */
{
  dev_t st_dev;    /* device of inode */
  ino_t st_ino;    /* inode number */
  short st_mode;   /* mode bits */
  short st_nlink;  /* number of links to file */
  short st_uid;    /* owners user id */
  short st_gid;    /* owners group id */
  dev_t st_rdev;   /* for special files */
  off_t st_size;   /* file size in characters */
  time_t st_atime; /* time last accessed */
  time_t st_mtime; /* time last modified */
  time_t st_ctime; /* time originally created */
};
```

The types `dev_t` and `ino_t` are defined in `<sys/types.h>`

The `st_mode` contains a set of flags describing the file.

The flag definitions are also included in `<sys/types.h>` we only need the part that deals with file types.

```c
#define S_IFMT  0160000 /* type of file: */
#define S_IFDIR 0040000 /* directory */
#define S_IFCHR 0020000 /* character special */
#define S_IFBLK 0060000 /* block special */
#define S_IFREG 0010000 /* regular */
/* ... */
```

## 8.7 Example - A Storage Allocator

Rather than allocating from a compiled-in fixed-size array, `malloc` will request space from
the operating system as needed.

Since other activities in the program may also request space
without calling this allocator, the space that `malloc` manages may not be contiguous.

Thus its free storage is kept as a list of free blocks.

Each block contains a size, a pointer to the next
block, and the space itself.

The blocks are kept in order of increasing storage address, and the
last block `(highest address)` points to the first.

When a request is made, the free list is scanned until a big-enough block is found.

This algorithm is called `first fit` by contrast with `best fit` which looks for the smallest block
that will satisfy the request.

- If the block is exactly the size requested it is unlinked from the
  list and returned to the user.

- If the block is too big, it is split, and the proper amount is
  returned to the user while the residue remains on the free list.

- If no big-enough block is found,
  another large chunk is obtained by the operating system and linked into the free list.

another large chunk is obtained by the operating system and linked into the free list.

Freeing also causes a search of the free list, to find the proper place to insert the block being
freed.

If the block being freed is adjacent to a free block on either side, it is coalesced aka colabsed with it
into a single bigger block, so storage does not become too fragmented.

Determining the adjacency is easy because the free list is maintained in order of decreasing address.

One problem, which we alluded to in **Chapter 5**, is to ensure that the storage returned by
malloc is aligned properly for the objects that will be stored in it.

Although machines vary, for each machine there is a most restrictive type: if the most restrictive type can be stored at a
particular address, all other types may be also.

On some machines, the most restrictive type is a `double`; on others, `int` or `long` suffices.

A free block contains a pointer to the next block in the chain, a record of the size of the block,
and then the free space itself; the control information at the beginning is called the header
To simplify alignment, all blocks are multiples of the header size, and the header is aligned properly.

This is achieved by a union that contains the desired header structure and an instance of the most restrictive alignment type,
which we have arbitrarily made a `long`
